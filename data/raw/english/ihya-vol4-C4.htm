CHAPTER IV<br>
POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION<br>
WHAT IS POVERTY?<br>
Know, 0 dear readers, that the meaning of poverty is not to possess what is necessary to remove wants.&nbsp;<br>
Not to have a thing what is not necessary is not poverty. If you have what is necessary and if you have&nbsp;<br>
got control over it you are not a poor man. In this sense, everybody is poor except God, as He is&nbsp;<br>
everliving. So God alone is above wants and everybody is dependent on Him. God says: God is above wants&nbsp;<br>
and you are poor-47:38. This is the widest meaning of poverty. We do not mean that in this chapter.&nbsp;<br>
What we mean here by poverty is want of riches. The necessity of man is unlimited. He who has got no&nbsp;<br>
riches is poor.<br>
FIVE CLASSES OF POVERTY-(1) The poverty of one who renounced the world. This condition is highest&nbsp;<br>
because he does not want riches though they come to him. He flees away from riches being displeased and&nbsp;<br>
takes care of their injuries and harms. This is renunciation. These are the people who have renounced&nbsp;<br>
the world. (2) The poverty of one who does not hate wealth but likes more to be above wants than to&nbsp;<br>
live in wants. If wealth comes to him without efforts, he does not refuse. He is a contented poor man.&nbsp;<br>
(3) He loves wealth but he does not make serious efforts for it. He is called a poor man with love of&nbsp;<br>
wealth. (4) He is a greedy poor man who has got desire to earn wealth and finds out various means to&nbsp;<br>
earn it. (5) The poor man who has got want of necessities and has got no wealth. (6) The condition of&nbsp;<br>
another poor man is highest. It is all one to him whether he has got wealth or no wealth. If wealth&nbsp;<br>
comes to himjhe is not pleased, and if it does not come, he is not displeased. He is not pleased to see&nbsp;<br>
that wealth should last with him, nor does he. want that it should go. He does not feel want out of&nbsp;<br>
riches and does not also consider himself rich in case of having riches. He has got self satisfaction,&nbsp;<br>
but he is not a rich man. God adorned his heart with the attribute of self satisfaction. He is not a&nbsp;<br>
slave of riches. The world renunciation is a basis of all his good works and is highest in his case.&nbsp;<br>
Ordinary world renunciation is harmful in this case, as the Virtues of the virtuous men are the evil&nbsp;<br>
deeds of those who are close to God. Any engagement with anything except God is<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	147<br>
an impediment to meeting with God. Hating the world is an act of engagement. So he who hates the world&nbsp;<br>
can be said to remain engaged in an action of the world. Your engagement with your self and your&nbsp;<br>
passion mean that you are busy without God. This is just like the lover and the beloved. He who looks&nbsp;<br>
to another in presence of his beloved sets up partnership in love. Similarly he<br>
who hates another leaving his act of love lessens his love.<br>
MERITS OF POVERTY<br>
Quran : God says : For the poor Refugees who have been driven out of their houses and properties, who&nbsp;<br>
seek pleasure from God and his blessings and help God and His Prophet ... God says : For those poor men&nbsp;<br>
who are confined in the way of God and unable to move in the world ... In these places, the poor have&nbsp;<br>
been praised.<br>
Hadis:- The Prophet once asked his companions as to who is best. They said : He who is in solvent&nbsp;<br>
circumstances and pays his dues therefrom. He said : He is good but he is not like one about whom I am&nbsp;<br>
speaking. The companions asked : 0 Messenger of God, who is best in that case ? He said : The poor man&nbsp;<br>
who gives his hard earned money in charity.<br>
The Prophet once said to Bilal : Meet with God as a poor man and not as a rich man. He said : God loves&nbsp;<br>
one having a big family and restraining himself from begging. The Prophet said : The poor among my&nbsp;<br>
followers will enter paradise 500 years before the rich. The Prophet said : The poor are the best among&nbsp;<br>
my followers and the weak among them will first roam in paradise before all. The Prophet said : I have&nbsp;<br>
got two dear things. If anybody loves both, he loves me and if anybody hates both hates me-poverty and&nbsp;<br>
jihad. It is reported that Gabrial once came to the Prophet and asked him : 0 Muhammad. God tenders you&nbsp;<br>
salam and asks you : Do you like that I should convert this mountain into that of gold for you and that&nbsp;<br>
wherever you will go, the mountain also should go with you ? At this the Prophet remained silent for a&nbsp;<br>
while and then said-O Gabriel the world is a house for one who has got no house and it is a wealth for&nbsp;<br>
one who has got no wealth. Hee who is not wise hoards for the world. Gabriel told him : 0 Muhammad, may&nbsp;<br>
God keep you steadfast on this firm truth. it is reported that Jesus Christ was once passing by a man&nbsp;<br>
who was asleep and he was covered with a cloth. He woke him up and<br>
148	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	149<br>
said: 0 sleeping man rise up and remember God. He said: What do you direct me to do? I have abandoned&nbsp;<br>
the world for the worldly men. He said to him: 0 dear friend, then sleep. Once the Prophet Moses was&nbsp;<br>
passing by a man who was sleeping on the ground. Under his head there was a brick and his face and&nbsp;<br>
beard were on the ground and he was covered with a blanket? The Prophet prayed to God: 0 my Lord, why&nbsp;<br>
is this servant of yours suffering in the world ? God revealed to him: 0 Moses, don't you know that I&nbsp;<br>
keep this world far away from one whom I love most. The companion Abu Rafe reported : Once a guest came&nbsp;<br>
to the Prophet but he had no food in his house. The Prophet sent me to a Jew of Khaiber for a loan of&nbsp;<br>
some quantity of wheat but the Jew refused it without something in mortgage. I returned to the Prophet&nbsp;<br>
and informed him. He said: By God, I am trustworthy to the dwellers of heaven and also trustworthy to&nbsp;<br>
the inmates of the world.<br>
<br>
If he had given me a loan I would have surely repaid it. Take my coat of mail and buy some wheat on&nbsp;<br>
mortgaging it. When he came out, this verse was revealed: Don't prolong your eyes for the things of&nbsp;<br>
various kinds I have given them for enjoyments, the splendor of the life of this world, through which I&nbsp;<br>
test them, but the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring-28:131.<br>
<br>
The Prophet said : He who among you rises at morn with his body sound, mind serene and with his daily&nbsp;<br>
livelihood, all the treasures of the world were as it were gathered for him. God said to Moses : When&nbsp;<br>
you see poverty coming to you say, welcome to the sign of the virtuous. The saint Ata Khorasani said :&nbsp;<br>
Once a Prophet was passing by the bank of a river and saw a man catching fishes. He threw his net in&nbsp;<br>
the name of God but did not get any fish. Then he passed by another man who threw his net in the name&nbsp;<br>
of the devil and got huge quantity of fish. The Prophet said : 0 my God, what is this matter ? You know&nbsp;<br>
that everything is in your hand. God said to the angels : Show to My servant the states of the two&nbsp;<br>
fisherman. When Moses saw the high honour kept for the first man and disgrace and dishonor for the&nbsp;<br>
second man, he said : 0 my Lord, I am satisfied, Our Prophet said: I peeped in-to paradise and saw that&nbsp;<br>
the majority of its innamtes are poor men. I peeped into Hell and saw that the majority of its inamates&nbsp;<br>
are the rich and women.<br>
The Prophet said: Poverty is a present for a believer in the world. It is reported in another&nbsp;<br>
tradition: Among the Prophets the Prophet Solaiman would go last to Paradise for his riches and among&nbsp;<br>
my followers Abdur Rahman-b-Auf will go last to Paradise on account of his wealth. Jesus Christ said :&nbsp;<br>
A rich man will enter paradise with great difficulty. The Prophet said : When God loves a servant, he&nbsp;<br>
surrounds him with dangers and difficulties, and when he loves one most. He gives him Eqtana. The&nbsp;<br>
companions asked him : What is Eqtana ? The Prophet said It is a condition of one who leaves no&nbsp;<br>
property and family. The Prophet also said : When you see poverty coming say. welcome to the sign of&nbsp;<br>
the virtuous. When you see wealth coming say : The punishment of sins is soon coming. Once the Prophet&nbsp;<br>
Moses asked God : 0 my Lord, who is dearest to Thee among Thy creations? I will love him God said :&nbsp;<br>
Every poor man. The Prophet Jesus Christ said : Certainly I love poverty and hate wealth.<br>
<br>
The wealthy and rich men of Arabia once said to the Prophet: Fix a day for us for interview with you&nbsp;<br>
and another day for the poor. We will not come to you on the day when they will come to you. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet told them: I will not fix till you and the poor men sit together in the same assembly. At once&nbsp;<br>
the revelation came : Keep patience along with those who invoke their Lord morning and evening seeking&nbsp;<br>
His pleasure and turn not your eyes from them seeing the adornment of this world's life and don't obey&nbsp;<br>
those whose hearts I have kept diverted from My remembrance and tell the truth from your Lord. Let him&nbsp;<br>
who wishes be a believer and let him who wishes be a disbeliever. The rich men were Aqra-bin- Habes.&nbsp;<br>
Aina-bin-Hasan etc. The poor men were-Hazrat Bilal, Salman-b-Shuaib. Abu Zarr, Khabbab, Abu Hurairah.&nbsp;<br>
Once a poor blind man sought permission to see the Prophet. At that time, the Prophet was deeply&nbsp;<br>
engaged in conversation with the honorable chiefs of the Quraish. When the Prophet did not give him&nbsp;<br>
permission at that time at once the revelation came from God (80:1)-He (Prophet) frowned and turned&nbsp;<br>
away, because a blind man came to him. Who will inform you that he might grow pure-80: 1?<br>
<br>
The Prophet said: On the Judgment day, God will gather together the poor men for taking accounts and&nbsp;<br>
say: By My glory and honour, I snatched away the world from you not for this<br>
150	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	151<br>
reason that you are small to Me but for bestowing upon you the honour and blessing that I have prepared&nbsp;<br>
for you. 0 dear servants, enter into this assembly, take out one who among this assembly gave you food&nbsp;<br>
or cloth by catching his hand. On that difficult day when the people will be afflicted with&nbsp;<br>
perspiration, he will enter that assembly and take out one who gave him food and cloth and enter&nbsp;<br>
paradise with him. The Prophet said : Keep company with the poor and acquire blessings from them, as&nbsp;<br>
there is wealth with them. The companions asked, 0 Messenger of God, what is their wealth ? The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said : When the Day of Judgment will come, they will be told : Take hold of the hand of those who gave&nbsp;<br>
you a handful of food, or a drought of water, or a piece of cloth and enter Paradise.<br>
The Prophet said: When I entered Paradise I heard the sound of the walking of a man and saw that he was&nbsp;<br>
Bilal. I found also in the upper station of Paradise the poor and their children. In the lower station&nbsp;<br>
of Paradise, I found a few rich men and women. I asked : 0 my Lord, what is their affair? He said : Two&nbsp;<br>
red things, gold and silk dress, kept the women pleased and long accounts kept the rich busy. I did not&nbsp;<br>
first find my rich companion Abdur Rahmen bin-Auf there, but afterwards he came to me weeping. I asked&nbsp;<br>
: What is the thing which kept you behind ? He said : 0 Prophet of God, I 'c'ould not reach you till I&nbsp;<br>
crossed Mushiat. I feared that I might not meet you. I asked : What is its reason ? He said : I was&nbsp;<br>
giving accountof my wealth.<br>
<br>
Now look what thing happened in the case of Abdur Rahman who was a reputed companion of the Prophet and&nbsp;<br>
who was one of the ten persons who had been given good news of Paradise in the world.<br>
Once the Prophet went to a poor man and saw that he had nothing. He said: If his light would have been&nbsp;<br>
distributed among the inhabitants of the world, it would have been sufficient. The Prophet said : Shall&nbsp;<br>
I not inform you about the kings of Paradise ? The companions said : 0 Messenger of God, inform us. He&nbsp;<br>
said Every weak man who is known to the people as weak, having disheveled hairs and dust ridden cloth,&nbsp;<br>
having only two pieces of cloth and bereft of honour. If he is given oath in the name of God. God&nbsp;<br>
proves him true.<br>
Hazrat Imran-in-Hussain reported : I had honour and status in the eyes of the Prophet. He told me once&nbsp;<br>
: 0 Imran, you have got honour before us. Will you go to see the ailing Fatima, daughter of the Prophet&nbsp;<br>
? I said : 0 Messenger of God, my parents be sacrificed to you. I will go. He rose up and I also&nbsp;<br>
accompanied him. When we reached the house of Fatima, he knocked at the door and said : Peace be on&nbsp;<br>
you, shall we enter Hazrat Fatima said : 0 Prophet of God, enter. He said : Myself and my companion ?&nbsp;<br>
Fatima said : 0 Prophet of God, who is with you ? He said Imran. Fatima said : By One who sent you as&nbsp;<br>
Prophet, I have got no wearing cloth except a blanket. He said: Do such and such and he hinted it with&nbsp;<br>
his hand. Fatema . said : If I cover my body therewith, my head remains uncovered. What shall I do. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet had an old sheet with him. He gave it to her and said: Cover your head with it. Then Fatema&nbsp;<br>
gave the Prophet permission to enter with his companion. When they both entered, the Prophet said : 0&nbsp;<br>
my darling, peace be on you. How are you, Fatema said : By God. I have got pain which has been&nbsp;<br>
increased by my hunger. Want of food and also. hunger afflicted me very much. The Prophet wept and said&nbsp;<br>
: 0 my darling, don't be worried. By God, I got nothing to eat for the last three days though I am much&nbsp;<br>
more honorable to God than you. If I had asked food from my Lord, He would have certainly given it to&nbsp;<br>
me, but I preferred the next world than this world. Then he placed his hand on his thigh and said: I&nbsp;<br>
give you good news that you would be the leader of the inmates of Paradise. Fatema said : In that case,&nbsp;<br>
what will be the position of Pharaoh's wife Asia and Mary, daughter of Imran. The Prophet said : Asia&nbsp;<br>
will be the leader among her contemporary women and Mary will be the leader among her contemporary&nbsp;<br>
women and you will be the leader of your contemporary women. You will live in Paradise made of emeralds&nbsp;<br>
and jewels. Then there will be no sorrow, no noise and no want of peace. By God, I got you married to&nbsp;<br>
such a person who is the leader of both this world and the next. Hazrat Ali reported that the Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said : When the people will hate the poor, construct lofty buildings in the world, vie with one another&nbsp;<br>
in amassing wealth, God will send on them four kinds of punishment-prevalence of famine, oppressions of&nbsp;<br>
kings and rulers, breach of agreements and oppression of the foes.<br>
152	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV SAYINGS OF SAGES<br>
<br>
Hazrat Abu Hurairah said: Three persons will enter paradise without account-(1) He who wish to wash his&nbsp;<br>
piece of cloth without getting another to put on, (2) he who has not got two pots to place on the oven,&nbsp;<br>
(3) and he who wishes to have drink but is' asked : Which kind of drink do you want? In other words, he&nbsp;<br>
who commits no excess in food, drink and dress will enter paradise without rendering account. It is&nbsp;<br>
reported that when a poor man came to Hazrat Sufiyan, he said to him: If you are a rich man, I will not&nbsp;<br>
allow you to come near. When his rich disciples saw him sitting near his poor disciples and distant&nbsp;<br>
from his rich disciples, the latter wished to be poor. The saint Muammel said : I saw the poor more&nbsp;<br>
honoured than the rich in the assembly of Sufiyan Saori. A certain sage said : If the unfortunate man&nbsp;<br>
feared Hell as he fears poverty, he would have got salvation from both. If he hoped for paradise as he&nbsp;<br>
hopes for riches, he would have got them both, If he feared God secretly as he fears men openly, he&nbsp;<br>
would have been fortunate in both the worlds.<br>
<br>
Hazrat Ibn Abbas said: He who respects riches and dishonors poverty, is cursed. Loqman advised his son&nbsp;<br>
: 0 darling, do not hate a man dressed with old cloth, as your Lord and his Lord is the same. The saint&nbsp;<br>
Ihya-bin-Ma'az said : To love the poor belongs to the conduct of the prophets. To sit in their assembly&nbsp;<br>
belongs to the conduct of the vituous. To flee from their company is the sign of the hypocrites. What&nbsp;<br>
Muwayiah, Ibn Amer and other persons gave as gifts to Hazrat Ayesha amounted daily to lacs of dirhams.&nbsp;<br>
She used to distribute them to the poor, yet her over- garment had stitches. Her maid told her: If you&nbsp;<br>
kept one dirharm, I would have purchased therewith meat for you and you could have broken fast&nbsp;<br>
therewith. He said : If you had reminded me of it, I would have done it.<br>
<br>
The Prophet used to give her advice and say: If you wish to live with me in paradise, live the life of&nbsp;<br>
the poor and shun the society' of the rich. Don't part with your overgarment till it is stitched. Once&nbsp;<br>
a man came to Ibrahim bin adbam with ten thousand dioramas. The man requested him to accept it Ibrahim&nbsp;<br>
said to him : Do you wish that by accepting the ten thousand dirhams, I would cut off my name from the&nbsp;<br>
register of the poor I shall never do it.<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	153<br>
STATUS OF THE TRUTHFUL AND<br>
SATISFIED POOR MAN<br>
<br>
The Prophet said: whose is guided to Islam,gets the provision of his livelihood and whose is satisfied&nbsp;<br>
with both should be thankful. He said : 0 assembly of the poor, give pleasure from your heart to God&nbsp;<br>
and you will then get the merits of poverty or else not It appears from these traditions. that the&nbsp;<br>
greedy poor man will not get meats for his poverty. The Prophet said : There is key to everything and&nbsp;<br>
the key to paradise is love for the poor They will sit with God on the Resurrection Day for their&nbsp;<br>
patecnce. The Prophet said : The poor man who is dearest to God is he who remains satisfied with what&nbsp;<br>
is with him and with the provision God gave him The Prophet said : 0 God, give sufficient provision for&nbsp;<br>
the family members of Muhammad. The Prophet said: There will be no poor or rich man who will not wish&nbsp;<br>
and say on the Resurrection Day : It would have been sufficient if there would have been for me bare&nbsp;<br>
provision of life in the world God revealed to the Prophet Ismail : Search Me near one who is broken&nbsp;<br>
hearted. The Prophet said : If a poor man remains satisfied, there is nobody better then him. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said : God will say on the resurrection day : Where are those among My creations who are&nbsp;<br>
pure-souled? The angels will ask: 0 God who are those people ? He will say They are those Muslims who&nbsp;<br>
remain satisfied with My gifts and with what I decreed for them Take them to Paradise, They will take&nbsp;<br>
there food and drink in paradise, while others will remain confined to rendering accounts.<br>
<br>
Sayings of Sages. Hazrat Omar said: Greed is poverty and despair is wealth. He who remains satisfied&nbsp;<br>
with being despaired of what is with the people remains free from them or indifferent. The sage Abu&nbsp;<br>
Mas'ud said : No day passes on which an angel does not proclaim below the Throne : 0 son of Adam, a&nbsp;<br>
little provision sufficient to sustain your life is better than enormous riches which attract towards&nbsp;<br>
infidelity. The sage Abu Darda said There is no man who has got no defect in his intellect. The reason&nbsp;<br>
of this is that when the world comes to him with great wealth and property, he becomes satisfied but&nbsp;<br>
the days and nights which are destroying his span of life do not grieve him. 0 son of Adam, alas for&nbsp;<br>
you. When your span of life is decreasing, what is the good of increasing wealth ? Some wise man was&nbsp;<br>
asked: What is wealth?<br>
nr i<br>
154	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
He said : Your little hope and your satisfaction with necessary things.<br>
<br>
It has been narrated that Hazrat Ibrahim bin-Adham was a<br>
great ruler of Khorasan. One day he looked down from his<br>
lofty palace and saw that a man was eating a loaf in his hand in the courtyard of his palace and after&nbsp;<br>
this he fell asleep. Hazrat Ibrahim told one of his servants : When he gets up from sleep, take him to&nbsp;<br>
me. When he awoke from sleep, the servant took him to the king who said to him: 0 man, have you eaten&nbsp;<br>
bread in hunger ? The man said : Yes. He asked him : Have you been satisfied with it ? He said : Yes.&nbsp;<br>
He asked: Have you slept with comfort? He said: Yes. Then Ibrahim said within himself : What shall I do&nbsp;<br>
with this world ? If I get this much, I should remain satisfied. Once a man was passing by the side of&nbsp;<br>
Amer-bin-Qais when he was eating vegetables with salt. He told the sage : 0 servant of God, are you&nbsp;<br>
satisfied with these small things ? The sage said : Shall I not give you information .-of a man who&nbsp;<br>
remains satisfied with a thing more insignificant than this he said : Inform me. The sage said : He is&nbsp;<br>
the man who remains satisfied with this world in lieu of the next world. The saint Muhammad-bin-Wa'se&nbsp;<br>
use to pick up dried bread mix it with water and eat it with salt and say : He who is satisfied with&nbsp;<br>
this little food in this world is free from being needy to the people. The great saint Hasan Basari&nbsp;<br>
said : God cursed those for whom He look oath but who did not believe it. Then he read the Quranic&nbsp;<br>
verse - &quot;There is provision for you in the sky and what you have been promised with.&quot; By the heaven and&nbsp;<br>
earth, that is certainly true. The companion Abu Zarr was once seated amongst the people when his life&nbsp;<br>
came to him and said : Are you seated amongst these people while there is nothing in the house to eat ?&nbsp;<br>
He said : 0 darling, there is a great problem before me. None but the God fearing can be free from it.&nbsp;<br>
Being satisfied with this word, she retired. The saint Jun-Nun said : He who does not have patience at&nbsp;<br>
the time of hunger is near disbelief. Once a saint was asked : What is your wealth ? He said : To&nbsp;<br>
harbor good ideas openly, to cherish hope in mind and not to hope for what is in the hands of the&nbsp;<br>
people. It is reported that God revealed in one of the ancient scriptures : 0 son of Adam, if you get&nbsp;<br>
the whole world, you will get nothing but the quantity of food that is necessary for you, when I give&nbsp;<br>
you from the world the quantity of food that<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	155<br>
is necessary for you, I put its account on others and do you good. For this reason, apoet said&nbsp;<br>
aboutsatisfaction:<br>
Seek what you wish from God, not from men,<br>
Be satisfied in joy,<br>
there is honour therein.<br>
On friends and relatives,<br>
don't be burden.<br>
Rich is he who hopes from God, not from men.<br>
Another poet said<br>
This hoarded wealth is not for you,<br>
but only for your heirs,<br>
Only that wealth will remain for you which you spend.<br>
Spend money with youthful vigour and with faith<br>
Be generous to one who<br>
distributes wealth.<br>
The honour and property<br>
gained from Him perish<br>
The satisfaction arising therefrom does not get old.<br>
SUPERIORITY OF POVERTY OVER WEALTH. Know, 0 readers, that the learned differed whether wealth is better&nbsp;<br>
than poverty or poverty is better than wealth. The savants Junaid, Khowas and other held that poverty&nbsp;<br>
is better than wealth. It is true in a general sense but doubt arises in two cases - firstly in the&nbsp;<br>
case of patient poor man who has no greed for wealth but remains satisfied with his lot and secondly in&nbsp;<br>
the case of a wealthy man who spends his wealth in good works and has got no greed for amassing wealth.&nbsp;<br>
The rich man who spends money in good works in better than the greedy poor man. The rich man<br>
156	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	157<br>
who remains engrossed in his riches is not better than the poor man who has greed for wealth. It is&nbsp;<br>
related that the poor once complained to the Prophet saying : the rich men do all acts of piety namely&nbsp;<br>
charity, Zakat pilgrimage. Jihad ect. The Prophet taught them certain words in praise of God and&nbsp;<br>
reminded them that the merits gained by the rich for this Doa (invocation) will be much less than those&nbsp;<br>
gained by the poor. The Prophet said that it is the grace of God and that God gives it to whom He&nbsp;<br>
wishes. the saint Ata quoted this Hadis and said that the rich are better than the poor. The meaning is&nbsp;<br>
reverse as it was said in that Hadis that the merits of the poor gained by the Doa are greater.<br>
It was reported by Anas that a representative of the poor came to the Prophet and said : I have come to&nbsp;<br>
you as a messenger of the poor. He said : Welcome to you and to those from whom you have come. They are&nbsp;<br>
a class of people whom I love. He said 0 Messenger God, the rich have taken away all the virtues. They&nbsp;<br>
make pilgrimage but we cannot do it. They make Umrah, but we cannot do it. If they fall all, they spend&nbsp;<br>
their excess wealth and gain virtues. The Prophet said : Inform the poor from me. The poor man among&nbsp;<br>
you who keeps patience and hopes for virtues will have such fortunes which the rich would not get. (1)&nbsp;<br>
The first fortune is that there is a very lofty place in paradise and the inmates will look at it as&nbsp;<br>
the people of this earth look at the stars on the firmament. The poor prophets, the poor martyrs and&nbsp;<br>
the poor believers will only get it. (2) The second fortune is that the poor will enter paradise half a&nbsp;<br>
day (500 years) earlier than the rich. (3) The third fortune is that when the rich man says&nbsp;<br>
'Sobhanallah. Walhamdo Lillah La I1aha Illah and Allho Akbar' as the poor recite them they will not get&nbsp;<br>
equal merits like the poor even though they spend thousands of Dirhams. This is the condition of every&nbsp;<br>
vituous act. The representative of the poor returned to them and said what the Prophet had said to him.&nbsp;<br>
The poor then said : We are satisfied. This proves that for every divine service, there is additional&nbsp;<br>
merit for the poor.<br>
The ultimate goal in this world is to attain the love of God, to seek His pleasure and to tread the&nbsp;<br>
path towards Him. It is not possible to achieve these in the midst of heavy engagements. It is true&nbsp;<br>
that poverty keeps a man engaged like wealth. To love the world is the real engagement as love of the&nbsp;<br>
world and love of God do not unite. He who loves anyone keeps themselves engaged in<br>
the world. Those who are deprived of the world keep themselves engaged in search of it. If it happens&nbsp;<br>
that you have rescued` yourself from the love of wealth which is like water in you sight, then it is&nbsp;<br>
all one whether you have got wealth or not. Every one uses it according to his necessity and to get it&nbsp;<br>
in times of necessity is better than not to have it. The hungry man walks in the path of death, not in&nbsp;<br>
the path of God. If you are engaged in the management of wealth, it is true that you live far away from&nbsp;<br>
the thoughts and anxieties of poverty but you are in the disaster of happiness. The disaster of&nbsp;<br>
happiness is more acute than that of adversity. Man cannot be free from it. For this, the companions&nbsp;<br>
said : We have been tried by the hardship of sorrows but we remained patient at them.<br>
<br>
Jesus Christ said: Don't look at the wealth of the worldly men as the radiance of their wealth will&nbsp;<br>
take away the light of your faith. Some wise man said : The disaster of wealth takes away the sweetness&nbsp;<br>
of faith. The Prophet said ; Every nation has its object of worship and the object of worship of this&nbsp;<br>
nation is silver and gold. The Prophet saw the world coming to him in beautiful appearance and said :&nbsp;<br>
Be off from me. The Prophet said : Contentment of mind lies not in riches, but in peace of mind. When i&nbsp;<br>
t is difficult, i t is better for the general masses not to have riches. If one possesses it, it is&nbsp;<br>
better for him to give it in charity and spend it in good works, as the possessor of wealth is led to&nbsp;<br>
the love of the world. A man goes away from the next world in proportion to his attachment to this&nbsp;<br>
world and goes away from the love of God and from God in proportion to this attachment to things other&nbsp;<br>
than God. When you will cut off the means of attachment to this world, you will slip away from the pomp&nbsp;<br>
and grandeur of the world. When mind turns away from things other than God and resigns to Him, it&nbsp;<br>
returns to God as mind cannot live in vacuum. There is in the world nothing but God and things other&nbsp;<br>
than God. He who proceeds towards things other than .God shifts away from God. He who proceeds towards&nbsp;<br>
God shifts away from things other than God. The proportion he advances towards one thing shifts away&nbsp;<br>
proportionately from another thing and the proportion he comes near one thing, goes away&nbsp;<br>
proportionately from another thing. It is just like distance of the west and the east. He who goes&nbsp;<br>
towards the west shifts from the east and vice versa. Similarly he who loves the world goes away from&nbsp;<br>
the next world. So he who loves the world very dearly goes farthest away from the next world.<br>
158	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
The substance of the above talk is that the question who is better among the two rich or poor can be&nbsp;<br>
answered from having a look to one's attachment to the wealth. If the poor man and the rich man are&nbsp;<br>
equal in their attachment to wealth, their status is equal. Some ancient sage said : The worshiper who&nbsp;<br>
seeks the world is like one who wants to extinguish fire by dried grass or like one who washes his hand&nbsp;<br>
with clarified butter to remove fat from hands. The saint Solaiman Darani said : The poor man who does&nbsp;<br>
not get his coveted things and then breaths a long sigh is better than the rich man who does divine&nbsp;<br>
service for one thousand years. The saint Zohhak said He who enters a market and greeds for a thing and&nbsp;<br>
then keeps patience to acquire virtues, is better than one who spends one thousand Dinars in the way of&nbsp;<br>
God. A man asked the saint Bashar bin Hares : Pray from me to God. I am having difficulties in&nbsp;<br>
maintaining family. He said : When your wife says to you : We have got no bread or wheat, pray for me&nbsp;<br>
as your invocation at that time is better than mine. He used to say<br>
The rich worshiper is like a garden in cowdung. The poor worshiper is like a necklace of pearls in the&nbsp;<br>
neck of a most beautiful woman. Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq said : 0 God, when my passion wants to fulfill&nbsp;<br>
its desire. I pray then to you for disgrace and I pray to you to be deprived of a thing which exceeds&nbsp;<br>
necessity. The best condition of possessing wealth is to earn lawful thing and spend lawful thing. For&nbsp;<br>
this also one shall have to wait and render accounts on the Resurrection Day. To wait for long to&nbsp;<br>
render accounts is also a punishment. For this reason the companion Hazrat Abdur Rahman-bin-Auf will be&nbsp;<br>
admitted in to paradise with delay as he would be engaged in rendering accounts. This is the tradition&nbsp;<br>
of the Prophet. The companion Abu Dara'a said: That I should have a shop near a mosque and that I&nbsp;<br>
should not miss a prayer or Zikr are dearer to me than that I should earn fifty dinars and spend them&nbsp;<br>
in the way of God. The people asked him: What is the harm ? He said : There is the fear of rendering&nbsp;<br>
accounts in that case.<br>
<br>
The saint Sufiyan said: The poor selected three things and the rich three. The poor selected peace of&nbsp;<br>
mind, vacant mind and scanty accounts and the rich selected self-trouble, engagement of mind and a&nbsp;<br>
strict rendering of account. The saint Ibn Ata said Freedom from want is an attribute of God. That is&nbsp;<br>
good for this<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	159<br>
reason that when a man become indifferent of having wealth or no wealth and when they become equal to&nbsp;<br>
him, his condition is like the above.<br>
Greedy poor and greedy rich man. Who is better among these two? When a man searches wealth and makes&nbsp;<br>
efforts to acquire it and then wealth comes to him, two conditions appear before him-when he has no&nbsp;<br>
wealth and when he has wealth. If he earns wealth up to the necessity of his livelihood and walks in&nbsp;<br>
the path of religion, it is better for him to earn such amount of wealth because poverty will keep him&nbsp;<br>
engage in earning wealth and prevent him from remembering God. For this reason the Prophet used to&nbsp;<br>
pray: 0 God, give me provision necessary for maintenance of Muhammad's family. He said : Poverty brings&nbsp;<br>
one near infidelity. The meaning of this poverty is such pressing want the removal of which is&nbsp;<br>
necessary for a man. If the object of earnings is not for treading the path of virtues; then poverty is&nbsp;<br>
better than riches as both are equal in the love of wealth and both do not abstain from committing sin.&nbsp;<br>
The Prophet said ; The Holy Spirit has infused into my mind: Love what you wish but you shall have to&nbsp;<br>
leave it. There is warning herein that separation from dear things is very painful. So love One from&nbsp;<br>
whom there is no separation. He is God, the Merciful. You should not love one whom you shall have to&nbsp;<br>
leave. That is the world. When you will love the world, you will not love to meet with God. If you die&nbsp;<br>
in that state, you shall have to leave it and you will get pain in proportion to your love for it. Now&nbsp;<br>
it is clear to you that poverty is better and more honorable than riches.<br>
Two exceptions: There are two exceptions to the above proportions. The first is to have riches like&nbsp;<br>
that of Hazrat Ayesha. To her it was equal to possess wealth or not to posses it, rather to have wealth&nbsp;<br>
was more beneficial to her than not to have wealth because she gave away all her wealth to the poor and&nbsp;<br>
the needy. The second exception is to have wealth less than what is absolutely necessary, as it leads&nbsp;<br>
to infidelity. It is in no circumstances better. He should have such wealth as can save his life and&nbsp;<br>
give strength in him and as can keep him far away from infidelity and sin. This is the meaning of&nbsp;<br>
poverty and riches. .<br>
The duties of the poor in poverty. The duties of the poor at the time of their poverty are secret,&nbsp;<br>
opens and connected with works. (1) The hidden duty is not to be dissatisfied with the<br>
160	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
action of God. It is true that the person who takes cupping is<br>
unwilling to take it on account of pain but he does not hate<br>
cupping, nor the cupper but entreats him at time. Similarly the<br>
disaster of poverty cannot be disliked as it is the work of God.<br>
Otherwise the merits gained by poverty is spoiled. To this effect,<br>
the Prophet said : 0 the assembly of the poor, give satisfaction to God from the core of your heart and&nbsp;<br>
then you will get the merits of poverty or else you will not get them. The next higher stage of poverty&nbsp;<br>
is to rest satisfied with poverty and not to hate it. The next higher stage is to seek poverty, to rely&nbsp;<br>
on God in mind and not to love things beyond necessity. Hazrat Ali said : God sometimes gives&nbsp;<br>
punishment by poverty and sometimes gives rewards. When it is a reward, the signs of reward are to&nbsp;<br>
treat well with the people, to obey God, not to complain against poverty and to express gratefulness to&nbsp;<br>
God for poverty. The signs of punishment are to treat badly with the people, to remain engaged in sins,&nbsp;<br>
to give up worship and to remain dissatisfied with luck.<br>
,, (2) The second duty of the poor during poverty is to abstain from beaging and not to express sorrows&nbsp;<br>
for poverty to anyone. The Prophet said : God loves the poor man having a big family, who abstains from&nbsp;<br>
begging. The saint Sufyan said: To express good thoughts at the time of want is good. A certain sage&nbsp;<br>
said : To keep poverty concealed is a treasure house of virtues.<br>
(3) The third duty of the poor during 'poverty is not to submit to the rich for their riches. Hazrat&nbsp;<br>
Ali said : In order to get virtues from God, it is better for a rich man to become humble to a poor&nbsp;<br>
man. Still more is the pride of a poor man relying of God over a rich man. This is the position of the&nbsp;<br>
poor. The lower position is not to have connection with the rich and not to desire to join in their&nbsp;<br>
assembly. The saint Sufiyan said : When a poor man keeps company with the rich know that he is&nbsp;<br>
ahypocrite. When he frequents the ruler, know that he is a dacoit. An Aref said : When a poor man&nbsp;<br>
keeps'company with the rich his faith lessens. When he greeds from them, pledge of protection goes from&nbsp;<br>
him. When he lives in their midst, he becomes misguided.<br>
MODE OF ACTIONS OF THE POOR : Don't be negligent in worship on account of poverty. If there is any&nbsp;<br>
excess wealth, do not hesitate to spend it to remove the wants of others, as charity of the poor to the&nbsp;<br>
poor is like jihad. There is a great merit in a poor<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	161<br>
man's spending a little than that of a rich man possessing enormous riches : The Prophet said : To&nbsp;<br>
spend a dirhams becomes sometimes better than spending one lac dirhams in the way of God. He was&nbsp;<br>
questioned : 0 Messenger of God, how does it happen. He said : A certain rich man spends one lac&nbsp;<br>
dirhams out of his enormous riches and a certain poor man possessing only two dirhams spends one&nbsp;<br>
dirhams in charity with a cheerful heart. In this circumstance, the spending of one dirhams by the poor&nbsp;<br>
man becomes better than the charity of one lac dirhams by the rich man.<br>
<br>
There are three stages of hoarding provisions: -The first stage is the highest and it is the stage of&nbsp;<br>
the truthful-not to hoard food except for one day and one night. The second stage is the stage of the&nbsp;<br>
God fearing man-to hoard food for 40 days. Beyond this, he becomes guilty of cherishing long hope. (3)&nbsp;<br>
The third stage is that of all religious men to hoard food for one year. This is the lowest stage. He&nbsp;<br>
who hoards beyond it is included within the ordinary people. The Prophet divided food-stuffs among his&nbsp;<br>
wives in this way. He used to give some of his food-stuffs for a year and some for one day and one&nbsp;<br>
night. Hazrat Ayesha and Hafsa are included within the second class.<br>
<br>
METHOD OF RECEIVING UNASKED FOR GIFTS: The poor shall have to look to three things for accepting the&nbsp;<br>
gifts of others-(1) source of gifted thing, (2) object of the gifts, (3) and the necessity of&nbsp;<br>
acceptance. With regard to the source of gift, the money of gift must be lawful and above doubt.&nbsp;<br>
Regarding the object of gifts the giver might have got many purposes-to get self-satisfaction to search&nbsp;<br>
the love of the receiver, to get merits from God, to get name and fame etc. If it is a present, there&nbsp;<br>
is no harm to accept it. The Prophet used to accept present from some people and reject it from others.&nbsp;<br>
He used to accept presents from the Quraish, Saqafi, Dausee and the Refugees and Ansars. Once a purse&nbsp;<br>
of 50 coins was presented to Fathe Musolli who said that Ata had recited this Hadis : If a thing is&nbsp;<br>
presented without asking and it is rejected God's gift is rejected. Then he took one coin out of the&nbsp;<br>
purse and returned the rest. The Saint Hasan Basari used to receive presents from his disciples. The&nbsp;<br>
saint Tamim used to receive small gifts from his disciples, not too much or rich presents. The saint&nbsp;<br>
Bashar Hafi said : I do not accept presents from anybody except Sarri Sakti as his renunciation seems&nbsp;<br>
to be<br>
162	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
good. He becomes pleased to give something from his hand and I help him in his satisfaction. Once a man&nbsp;<br>
from Khorasan took some money to Junaid who said : Distribute it among the poor. He said : I have not&nbsp;<br>
come to you with that intention. He said Shall I live up to the time of its enjoyment. He said : I&nbsp;<br>
don't wish that you should spend it in purchasing vegetables but in getting sweet things. He then&nbsp;<br>
accepted it. The man of Khorasan said There is nobody at Bagdad whose benefit is greater than yours.&nbsp;<br>
The saint Junaid said : I should not accept from anybody but from men like you.<br>
Second rule. If the donee gifts for acquiring merits, the poor receiver will examine whether the gift&nbsp;<br>
is fit to be accepted. If he falls in doubt, he should not accept it. If the poor acceptor is engaged&nbsp;<br>
in private sin and thinks that if the giver knows it, he will not gift it to him, his acceptance of&nbsp;<br>
gift in that case is unlawful.<br>
Third rule. If the purpose of gift is to earn name and fame or show of honesty, it should be rejected.&nbsp;<br>
If accepted, it will help his dishonest purpose. Whatever was given to Sufyan Saori, he used to reject&nbsp;<br>
it and say: Had I known that they would not broadcast it. I would have accepted it.<br>
NECESSITY OF ACCEPTING GIFTS: The Prophet said: When the receiver of gift accepts it on account of&nbsp;<br>
necessity the giver does not get more merit than him. He also said : Whatever is given without asking&nbsp;<br>
should be taken to be a provision from God. In other words, he shall not reject it. Some wise man said&nbsp;<br>
: If a man does not accept what is offered to him, he will fall in such a disaster that if he want&nbsp;<br>
something in future from others, they won't give it. The saint Sarri Sakti used to send presents to&nbsp;<br>
Imam Ahmed. Once he returned his present Sarri Sakti said to him : 0 Ahmed, fear the danger of&nbsp;<br>
rejection, as the danger of rejection is greater than that of acceptance. Imam Ahmed said to him : Say&nbsp;<br>
what, you have said : He repeated it. Imam Ahmed then said : I returned it as I have a provision of one&nbsp;<br>
month with me. Keep it with you and give it to me after one month. The Prophet said The son of Adam has&nbsp;<br>
got no right except in three things, such a food as can keep his backbone erect, (2) such a cloth as&nbsp;<br>
can keep his private parts concealed, (3) and such a house as can protect him from cold and heat.&nbsp;<br>
Beyond this, the extra wealth is included within wealth which is to be accounted for. There is merit in<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	163<br>
whatever you take for these three things. If you accept things beyond these without committing sins,&nbsp;<br>
you shall have to render accounts for them. And if you become disobedient to God, you shall have to&nbsp;<br>
receive punishment.<br>
A certain man gave instructions at the time of his death to distribute his property to three groups of&nbsp;<br>
persons-those who are strong, those who are charitable and those who are above wants. He was asked&nbsp;<br>
about their particulars. He said : The strong men are those who rely on God. The charitable persons are&nbsp;<br>
those who have good thoughts about God and the rich are those persons who give up everything for God.&nbsp;<br>
The poor man ought to look that whatever he accepts, he accepts from God and not from the giver as the&nbsp;<br>
latter is only a means. God made him submit to him to make charity.<br>
It is reported that a certain person invited the sage Shaqiq Balakhi with his fifty followers to take&nbsp;<br>
feast. The man placed all kinds of his food on the dining cloth. Shaqiq sat on it and said to his&nbsp;<br>
disciples : The master o7the house is saying : My food is unlawful for one who says that I have not&nbsp;<br>
prepared this food and placed it before him. At this, all of them went out except a young man who was&nbsp;<br>
lower than them in piety. The master of the house said to Shaqiq : What was your intention to say this&nbsp;<br>
? He said ; I told them this to examine my disciples in Tauhid.<br>
The Prophet Moses said : 0 my Lord, you have entrusted my food to the children of Israil. They give me&nbsp;<br>
food for one night and then again on the night following. God revealed to him : Thus I reward my&nbsp;<br>
friends. I give their food to the oppressors, so that they may get rewards. So if anybody gives&nbsp;<br>
something in charity, he must believe that God has given him direction to give that thing for charity.<br>
IN WHAT CASES BEGGING IS NOT LAWFUL? Begging is principally unlawful for three reasons. The first&nbsp;<br>
reason is that it is complaint against God if one expresses his wants. In other words, he expresses&nbsp;<br>
want of kindness of God. If a slave begs of others, he dishonors his master. Similarly if a slave of&nbsp;<br>
God begs of others, he defames God and for this reason begging is unlawful. In case of dire necessity,&nbsp;<br>
it becomes lawful, as it is lawful in extreme cases to eat a dead body. The second reason is that by&nbsp;<br>
begging one introduces himself as worthless before others. To<br>
164	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
humble oneself before anybody other than God is not the duty of a believer. Others also stand in need&nbsp;<br>
of God like him. So if one is to beg, he must beg of his master and not of slaves. The third reason is&nbsp;<br>
that the beggar puts him to shame and difficulty from whom something is begged of, Sometimes he does&nbsp;<br>
not give willingly or with satisfied mind. He is compelled sometimes out of shame or other reasons to&nbsp;<br>
give the beggar. So giving trouble to anybody is unlawful.<br>
The Prophet said : To beg of men is a disgraceful thing. He did not make anything so disgracing as&nbsp;<br>
begging. Even an unlawful thing becomes lawful in case of dire necessity. It is just like the drinking&nbsp;<br>
wine by a man whose throat has been choked by food and then nothing but wine is found there. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said He who begs inspite of having wealth, increases burning charcoal of Hell for himself. He&nbsp;<br>
also said : He who begs inspite of his possessing necessary thing will come on the Resurrection Day&nbsp;<br>
with his face bare of flesh with only bones. In another narration, his begging will make his face&nbsp;<br>
filled up with scratches. Once the Prophet took oath of allegiance from a people on condition that they&nbsp;<br>
would hear and obey him. At that time he said. to them: Don't seek anything from people. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
used to say : He who begs of me, I shall give him and he who does not beg, God will give him. He is&nbsp;<br>
dear to us who does not beg of us. He also said: Be free from begging of men. The lesser you beg, the&nbsp;<br>
better. The companions asked : Shall we beg of you ? He said : Beg of me a little.<br>
Once Hazrat Omar heard that after every Magrib prayer one man used to beg. He told one of his people :&nbsp;<br>
Give him food. He gave him food. Again Hazrat Omar heard that he was begging. At this he told.that man&nbsp;<br>
: Have I not told him to give good ? He said : I gave him food Hazrat Omar then saw that under his hand&nbsp;<br>
he had got a bag full of bread. He told him: You are not a beggar but a merchant. He then took his bag&nbsp;<br>
of bread and spread it out to the camels of Zakat, gave him lashes and said : Don't do it again. This&nbsp;<br>
shows that begging is unlawful.<br>
In case of necessity, begging becomes lawful but necessity admits of four stages-dire necessity,&nbsp;<br>
special necessity, little necessity and want of necessity. The case of dire necessity is in the case of&nbsp;<br>
a man when he is extremely hungry and reaches the point of death for want of food or at least when he&nbsp;<br>
fears it, when<br>
Vol-IV ,	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	165<br>
he falls ill, when he does not get cloth to cover his shame. In these and similar cases, begging&nbsp;<br>
becomes lawful. The second stage is a bare necessity and not pressing necessity. A sick man has got the&nbsp;<br>
necessity of medicine. He can beg of it. A man can walk on foot, but his asking for hire of a camel is&nbsp;<br>
lawful. The third stage is of little necessity. It is just like the asking of a shirt from a person in&nbsp;<br>
order to cover his body for which he has no means. It is just like the begging of a man for curry when&nbsp;<br>
he has got bread. In case of no necessity, begging is unlawful.<br>
<br>
IN WHICH CASES BEGGING IS LAWFUL? There are three conditions of a beggar -(1) to believe that he is&nbsp;<br>
giving with a satisfied mind, (2) To believe that he is giving with a dissatisfied mind. (3) in the&nbsp;<br>
third case, there is doubt whether he is giving with a satisfied mind or dissatisfied mind. In the&nbsp;<br>
first case, taking charity is lawful and in the second case it is unlawful. In the third case it is&nbsp;<br>
doubtful whether it is lawful or unlawful. At this time of doubt, he must ask his conscience. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said: Whatever raises doubt in mind, leave it and whatever does not raise doubtin mind, accept&nbsp;<br>
it. The Prophet said : To eat out of own's own earnings is most pure. He also said : He who begs having&nbsp;<br>
riches begs of burning charcoal. Let him seek little or more of it. This is a clear Hadis prohibiting&nbsp;<br>
beggary. The Prophet said Don't be greedly to seek the riches of others possessing something given by&nbsp;<br>
God. The companions asked : What is its amount? He said : Morning food and night food, In another&nbsp;<br>
tradition : He who begs having 50 or 40 dirhams or gold equivalant to is value begs importunately. In&nbsp;<br>
this connection we shall have to remember that the Prophet said : The son of Adam has got no right&nbsp;<br>
except in three things-(1) such a quantity of food as can keep his backbone erect, (2) such a quantity&nbsp;<br>
of cloth as can keep his private parts concealed (3) and such a house as can protect him. Beyond these&nbsp;<br>
things, he shall have to ren for account. This is the basis of necessity having regard to kind,&nbsp;<br>
quantity and time (1) Kind. Whatever is necessary for himself and his family members and whatever&nbsp;<br>
animal he possesses are included within this class. (2)Quantity. Regarding the quantity of cloth&nbsp;<br>
necessary for a religious man, it is one piece of wearing cloth, one shirt, one piece of hand kerchief&nbsp;<br>
and one piece of trouser. What is more than one piece is not necessary. Household untensils and&nbsp;<br>
furnitures are also likewise. Regarding daily quantity of food it is one and a half poa. Take what is&nbsp;<br>
necessary<br>
<br>
166	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
for bare livelihood. Enjoyment of curries is additional. There should be no grandeur in house. Want is&nbsp;<br>
what a man lacks in his food for one day and one night, a house for his protection and a<br>
cloth for his wearing.<br>
<br>
There are three stages of begging for future-(1) begging for the necessaries of tomorrow, (2) begging&nbsp;<br>
necessary things for 40 or 50 days (3) and begging of the necessary things for one year. If one&nbsp;<br>
possesses food for himself and family members for for one year, begging is unlawful. For this reason,&nbsp;<br>
the tradition says that he who possesses 50 dirhams is rich, as 50 dirhams are sufficient for a man for&nbsp;<br>
a year.<br>
<br>
Three classes of beggers; One class of beggars do not beg of ethers and do not accept even when&nbsp;<br>
offered. These beggars are of the highest order and will live in paradise. The second class of beggars&nbsp;<br>
do not beg anything of others but accept it when offered. These beggars will also live in Paradise. The&nbsp;<br>
third class of beggars beg In case of dire necessity. They are the companions of fortune and will live&nbsp;<br>
with the truthful.<br>
When Ibrahim Adham came once to Shaqiq Balakhi, the latter said to him : In what condition have you&nbsp;<br>
left your poor people? He said : I have left them in such a condition that if they are given something&nbsp;<br>
they would express gratefulness and if they are not given anything, they would keep patience. Shaqiq&nbsp;<br>
said When I left Balkh, I found my neighboring dogs in that condition. Ibrahim asked him : 0 Abu Ishaq,&nbsp;<br>
what attributes should the poor possess according to. you ? Shaqiq said : In our opinion, if the poor&nbsp;<br>
are not given of what they beg, they should also express gratefulness..If they are to be given&nbsp;<br>
something, it should be given to those who are more needy among them. Ibrahim kissed his hand and said:&nbsp;<br>
0 my teacher, you are true.<br>
A certain man saw Abu Ishaq Nuri to beg something from men spreading out his hands and said : I was&nbsp;<br>
surprised at it and though it bad. I informed it to Junaid who said : Don't think it bad, and you&nbsp;<br>
should not think that Abu Ishaq Nuri is asking something from men, rather he accepts from men that they&nbsp;<br>
may gain virtues in the hereafter and no hardship reaches them. It seemed as if he hinted at this&nbsp;<br>
Hadis: The upper hand is better than the lower. Then Junaid said : Bring a balance. He then weighed one&nbsp;<br>
jundred dirhams, took a handful of dirhams from<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	167<br>
another purse and mixed them with those and said : Take these dirhams to Nuri. I thought in mind that&nbsp;<br>
it is a wonder that Junaid took a balance for weight and then mixed one hundred dirhams with unmeasured&nbsp;<br>
dirhams and sent it to Nuri. I felt ashamed to ask him the reason. I took the entire purse and went to&nbsp;<br>
Nuri who took a balance measured one hundred dirhams and said : Take this one hundred dirhams to Junaid&nbsp;<br>
and tell him : I shall not take it from him but I accept the additional dirhams. At this, my wonder&nbsp;<br>
increased more and on asking Nuri he said : Junaid is a wise man. He wants to take hold of both the&nbsp;<br>
ends of along rope. He weighed one hundred dirhams for his sake, so that be may gain rewards in the&nbsp;<br>
hereafter. He then took one handful of dirhams without weighing and gave it in the way of God. Whatt&nbsp;<br>
has been given in the way of God. I accepted and what he gave for his own sake. I look it to Junaid who&nbsp;<br>
wept and said : He accepted his money and returned my money to me. God is the Helper.<br>
Now took how bright and pure was their minds and what' sincere was their desires to worship. Even one&nbsp;<br>
of them: could speak of the thoughts of the inner mind of another on account of the broadening of their&nbsp;<br>
breast as a result of their eating lawful things, keeping their minds clear from attaellment of the&nbsp;<br>
world and advancing towards God with hopes and desires. He who does not admit it before experience in&nbsp;<br>
the path is a fool just at a man does not admit it easy before taking any medicine to have purgation.&nbsp;<br>
If anybody does not acquire the merit of Kashf after hard labour and does not think it possible for&nbsp;<br>
others, he is like a person who takes.medicine for purgation but it does not work for some internal&nbsp;<br>
diseass. This is ignorance. He who has got Kashf reaches the stage of Ainul Eqin or veritable sight by&nbsp;<br>
eyes. It is higher than sight by knowledge (Ilmul Eqin). He who is free from Ilmul Egin or Ainul Egin&nbsp;<br>
is out of the group of believers. Their 'minds are dead and they are the followers of the devils.<br>
SECTION 2<br>
RENUNCIATION OF THE WORLD<br>
Renunciation of the world is an honored stage out of many stages of the sojourners towards the path of&nbsp;<br>
religion. This stage is also regulated like other stages in respect of knowledge, condition and action.&nbsp;<br>
In accordance with the sayings of the sages, all the doors of Iman returns to sure faith, speech and&nbsp;<br>
action. But<br>
168	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
out of these, the stage of speech can be established on the stage of condition on account of its&nbsp;<br>
expression. The object of speech is not speech but expression of thoughts of mind. If speech does not&nbsp;<br>
come out of condition, it is called Islam not Iman. Knowledge is the cause of condition and condition&nbsp;<br>
is the cause of knowledge. Action comes out of condition and action is the result of condition.<br>
<br>
STATEMENT OF CONDITION: We shall call this condition<br>
renunciation. In other worlds, it is the turning away from a thing in<br>
order to get a better thing than it. So he who does not love a thing<br>
turns away from that thing and he who loves a thing turns towards<br>
that thing and is attached to it. Two things are necessary for renunciation. (1) Firstly, to turn away&nbsp;<br>
from a thing and to be attached towards a thing. So the latter is better than the first. He who has&nbsp;<br>
renunciated riches and wealth is called one who renunciated the world. He who sells his world in lieu&nbsp;<br>
of the next world is called one who renounces the world. He who sells his next world in exchange of&nbsp;<br>
this world, is one who renounces the next world. So the meaning of renunciation is to love a dear thing&nbsp;<br>
and to advance towards another dear thing which is dearer than the former. He who renounces things&nbsp;<br>
other than God, even the highest Paradise and does not love things other than God is Jahed or who&nbsp;<br>
renunciated the world. Who turns away from the worldly comforts and seeks the comforts of the next&nbsp;<br>
world, his position is lower than the former. The meaning of Tauba is to forsake sins and the meaning&nbsp;<br>
of renunciation is to leave such lawful things as are the causes of physical pleasure. So to leave the&nbsp;<br>
lawful things in the world is called renunciation. To leave things other than God and turn towards God&nbsp;<br>
is renunciation. This is the highest stage. Someone addressed Ibnul Mobarak : 0 one who renunciated the&nbsp;<br>
world. He replied : Caliph Omar-bin-Abdul Aziz is the person who renunciated the world, as the world&nbsp;<br>
came to him with its fineries but he rejected them. What subjects shall I leave? I have gotnothing.<br>
KNOWLEDGE: The knowledge which is the fruit of condition is this. The thing which is given up in&nbsp;<br>
comparison with the thing accepted is worse and it is the fruit of the knowledge of a business man. He&nbsp;<br>
knows that what he accepts in lieu of his sold thing is better and for that he is more attached to it.&nbsp;<br>
He who has not got this knowledge loses no attachment to the thing sold. Similarly he who knows that&nbsp;<br>
what is near God is everlasting and that the next- world is ever-lasting and better, accepts jewel in<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	169<br>
lieu of short- lived ice, as jewel is better than ice. The owner of ice knows it well and is eager to&nbsp;<br>
sell it in lieu of jewel. Similarly he knows the world as temporary and therefore accepts the ever&nbsp;<br>
lasting next world. The world is short-lived like ice. Ice melts at the touch of sun-shine, but the&nbsp;<br>
next world is a jewel without end. So there should be the knowledge of this world and the next world.&nbsp;<br>
The greater this knowledge, thegreater the strength. He whose belief in this is sure and firm sells&nbsp;<br>
this world in lieu of the next world and sells his riches and wealth. God says-(9:111) Surely God&nbsp;<br>
purchased from the believers their lives and properties in exchange that they will get Paradise. God&nbsp;<br>
even informs us that there is profit in this business in verse-9:111-Give good news for your&nbsp;<br>
transaction with God which you have carried on. So for the purpose of renunciation, this much of&nbsp;<br>
knowledge is necessary that the next world is better than this world and ever lasting. God says about&nbsp;<br>
this world: Say, the commodities of this world are but short -lived. He says about the next world :&nbsp;<br>
Those who were given knowledge said : Woe to you, God's reward is better-28: 80.<br>
<br>
ACTION: The action which arises from renunciation is to accept what is better in lieu of what is worse.&nbsp;<br>
The business of this buy and sale is called renunciation. Similarly to forsake all the pleasures of&nbsp;<br>
this world and to accept what is in the next world is renunciation. To accept God and to reject things&nbsp;<br>
other than God is true renunciation.<br>
<br>
` Ibn Abi Laila said to the sage Ibn Shabrama : Don't you see that the son of a weaver Abu Hanifa&nbsp;<br>
rejects whatever decision we give ? The sage Ibn Shabrama said : I don't know whether he is the son of&nbsp;<br>
a weaver or the son of a respectable man. But I know that the world came to him but he fled away from&nbsp;<br>
it. The world is fleeing away fromus but we are following it. At the time of the Prophet, the Muslims&nbsp;<br>
said : We love our Lord. Had we known what things would bring His love, we would have loved them. Then&nbsp;<br>
God revealed this verse : Had We prescribed for them 'Give your lives or go out of your houses'. They&nbsp;<br>
would not obey it except a few-4 : 66. The Prophet said to Ibn Masud : You are included within those&nbsp;<br>
few. Ibn Masud said : We did not know that there are some persons among us who love this world until&nbsp;<br>
this verse was revealed-Among you there are some who love this world and some who love the next&nbsp;<br>
word.-3:152.<br>
170	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
MERITS OF WORLD RENUNCIATION. God says : Those<br>
who were given knowledge, said : We to you. The reward of God<br>
is best for those who have faith and do good deeds-28 : 80. It appears from this verse that God mixed&nbsp;<br>
renunciation with knowledge. He says : They will be given double rewards for their patience. In this&nbsp;<br>
verse He has spoken of those who renunciated the world. God again says : Of those who renounced the&nbsp;<br>
world. God again says : We have created what Is in the earth as adornment. By that, We shall try who is&nbsp;<br>
best in action. By this, world renunciation has been spoken of as the best. God says: We will increase&nbsp;<br>
cultivation of one who wishes that of the next world. He will give the cultivation of one who wishes&nbsp;<br>
that of this world, but he will have no share in the next world. God says Don't prolong your eyes&nbsp;<br>
towards what We have provided them of different kinds of the adorment of this world in order to try&nbsp;<br>
them therein, but the provision of your Lord better and more<br>
lasting-20:31.<br>
Hadis-(1) The Prophet said ; God makes the affairs of one who rises early in the morning with thoughts&nbsp;<br>
of this world manysided. He makes divisions of his wealth and places property before his eyes, although&nbsp;<br>
he will have nothing of the world except what has been destined for him. God gather the thoughts of one&nbsp;<br>
in one place who rises early in the morning with the thoughts of the next world, protects his&nbsp;<br>
properties, gives satisfaction to his mind and the world comes to him with eager expectation. (2) The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet also said: Come near one whom you see tal&#149;Cing silence and renouncing the world, because wisdom&nbsp;<br>
meets him. (3) For this reason the wise said : God causes the fountain of wisdom flow in the mind of&nbsp;<br>
one who renounces the world upto 40 days and fills up his tongue with eloquence. (4) A certain&nbsp;<br>
companion said : We asked the Prophet : 0 Messenger of God, who is best? He said: The believer whose&nbsp;<br>
heart is protected and whose tongue is truthful. We asked, 0 Messenger of God, what is protection of&nbsp;<br>
heart. He said : God fearing pure heart which has got no treachery, deceit, disobedience hatred and&nbsp;<br>
malice. We asked. 0 Messenger of God, who is the next best? He said : He who hates the world and loves&nbsp;<br>
the next world. From this it is clear that he who loves the world is worst. (5) The Prophet said ; If&nbsp;<br>
you wish to have God's love, take recourse to renunciation in the world. So make renunciation a cause&nbsp;<br>
for love. He who is loved by God is placed in the highest rank. (6) The<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	171<br>
Prophet said : Renunciation and God fear enkindle light every night in mind. If both of them finds a&nbsp;<br>
mind which ha got Iman and shame, they stay therein or else they go away. (7) Once Habesa asked the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet : Am I a real believer. The Prophet asked him : What are the true signs of your belief. He said&nbsp;<br>
: When my mind is separated from the world, stone and gold appear equal to me. It seems that I see Hell&nbsp;<br>
and Paradise with my eyes and the throne of my Lord lies near me. The Prophet said : Stay in the&nbsp;<br>
condition in which you are now. You are such a servant whose heart has been illumined by God by the&nbsp;<br>
light of faith. (8) Once the Prophet was asked about the following verse : God expands the breast of&nbsp;<br>
one for Islam for whom He wishes gudicance (6:124). He explained the expansion by saying that it is a&nbsp;<br>
kind of light. When it enters the breast, it expands. He was again asked : 0 Messenger of God has it&nbsp;<br>
got any sign ? He said: It has got its sign mind turning away from the house of deception towards the&nbsp;<br>
everlasting abode and preparing for death before death actually comes. (9) The Prophet said : Be&nbsp;<br>
ashamed of God as is due to Him. They said : We are ashamed of God. He said:. That is not so. Why do&nbsp;<br>
you construct a house wherein you are unable to live ? Why do you save what you are unable to enjoy ?&nbsp;<br>
This shows that these two things are opposed to shame for God. (10) Once a deputation came to the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet and said : We are believers. The Prophet asked them. What are the signs of your belief ? They&nbsp;<br>
said : We keep patience at dangers and difficulties, we express gratefulness at the time of ease, we&nbsp;<br>
remain satisfied with the decree of fate and refrain from expressing satisfaction at the dangers and&nbsp;<br>
difficulties of our foes. The Prophet said : If your condition is such as you describe, then amass not&nbsp;<br>
what you are unable to enjoy and construct not a house wherein you are unable to live, and greed not&nbsp;<br>
what you shall have to leave. He advised them to take to renunciation in order to make perfect their&nbsp;<br>
faith. (11) Hazrat Jaber reported : The Prophet once said at the time of his sermon : He who truly&nbsp;<br>
believes that there is no deity but God and does not mix therewith any other thing, Paradise is sure&nbsp;<br>
for him. Hazrat Ali said at this : My father and mother be sacrificed to thee, 0 Messenger of God, give&nbsp;<br>
us satisfaction by describing what we should not mix therewith. He said : Love of this world and search&nbsp;<br>
for this world and to follow it. A party of men give advice like Prophets but act like proud men and&nbsp;<br>
oppressors. Paradise is sure for one in whose belief in the word &quot;There is no deity but God,&quot; there&nbsp;<br>
remains nothing of these faults. (12) The<br>
172	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	173<br>
Prophet said : Generosity grows out of sure faith and a man of<br>
sure faith shallnot enter Hell. Miserliness grows out of doubt. He<br>
who has got doubt in faith shall not enter Paradise. (13) He also said : 'The generous man is near God,&nbsp;<br>
near men and near Paradise, but the miser is distant from God. distant from men and near Hell.'&nbsp;<br>
Miserliness is a result of attachment to the world. Generosity is the result of renunciation of the&nbsp;<br>
world. It is impossible to praise the result without praising what produces the result. (14) The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said : God gives wisdom to the mind of one who has renounced the world, guides his tongue with&nbsp;<br>
wisdom, informs him of the causes and cures of the diseases of the world and then takes him to the&nbsp;<br>
abode of peace with ease from this world. (15) Once the Prophet was passing by a pound of camels with&nbsp;<br>
his companions. Some of the camels were pregnant and some milk-giving. Camels are a great wealth to the&nbsp;<br>
Arabs, as they can be used as conveyances and benefits are derived from their meat, hairs, milk and&nbsp;<br>
hides. The Prophet turned his face from those camels and closed his eyes. The companions asked : 0&nbsp;<br>
Messenger of God, camel is a precious thing to us. Why don't you look to them. The Prophet said : God&nbsp;<br>
prohibited me to look towards wealth. Then he recited this verse : We have given abundance to many of&nbsp;<br>
them. This is the adornment of this world's life. Don't stretch your eyes towards that.<br>
<br>
Hazrat Ayesha said : I began to feel sorrow when I saw the Prophet hungry and said : 0 Messenger of&nbsp;<br>
God, why don't you pray to God for food. He said : 0 Ayesha, by One in whose hand there lies my life,&nbsp;<br>
had I prayed to my Lord, the mountains of the world would have followed me being filled up with gold.&nbsp;<br>
They would have moved to the place, where I wished, but I preferred in the world hunger in place of&nbsp;<br>
satisfaction, poverty in place of wealth and riches of the world, and sorrows and difficulties in place&nbsp;<br>
of pleasures and enjoyments of the world. 0 Ayesha, God is not pleased with anything in case of the&nbsp;<br>
resolute Prophets than their patience in sorrows and difficulties and patience in their dear things. He&nbsp;<br>
will never be satisfied by not giving me these sorrows and difficulties which He gave to the Prophets.&nbsp;<br>
God says 'Keep patience as the resolute Prophets kept patience.' By God, I shall certainly keep&nbsp;<br>
patience to my utmost as they kept patience. There is no might and strength except through God. (16)&nbsp;<br>
Once the Prophet's widow who was the daughter of Hazrat Omar and named Hazrat Hafsa said to her father&nbsp;<br>
: Many deputations come<br>
to you from many distant places. You should take up decent dress and give order for delicious foods for&nbsp;<br>
you and for your guests. Hazrat Omar said : 0 Hafsa, don't you know that the family members of a man&nbsp;<br>
know his condition best. She said : I know it. Hazrat Omar said : I ask you again. h:on't you know how&nbsp;<br>
the Prophet and his family members lived during his Prophethood. If they enjoyed breakfast, they&nbsp;<br>
remained hungry at night, and if they enjoyed food at night, they remained hungry at noon. I ask you in&nbsp;<br>
the name of God : Don't you know that until the victory at Khaibar the Prophet and his family members&nbsp;<br>
could not enjoy dates. I ask you in the name of God, don't you know how the Prophet disliked the&nbsp;<br>
keeping of food in his basket for his use, so much so that the colour of his face in that case became&nbsp;<br>
changed. Then he took the food from the pot and placed it on the ground. I ask you again in the name of&nbsp;<br>
God : Don't you know that the Prophet used to sleep on a double folded blanket. I prepared for him one&nbsp;<br>
night a bed four-floded and he slept thereon. Rising from sleep he said : I could not pray Tahjjud&nbsp;<br>
(night) prayers as I slept on a four folded blanket. Make it two folded as on the previous occasions. I&nbsp;<br>
ask you again in the name of God: Don't you know that the Prophet once kept his wearing cloth for wash.&nbsp;<br>
Then Bilal called him for prayer, but he found no such cloth as he could wear and come out therewith&nbsp;<br>
for prayer. After it was heated by the sun and dried up, he wore it and came out for prayer. I ask you&nbsp;<br>
again in the name of God : Don't you know that a woman of Jafar. tribe gave two pieces of cloth one&nbsp;<br>
sheet and one Tahband-for the Prophet and sent one piece in advance. He covered his waist with one end&nbsp;<br>
of that piece and back with the other end and prayed in that condition.<br>
<br>
Thus Hazrat Omar began to question her. At this Hazrat Hafsa began to weep. Hazrat Omar also began to&nbsp;<br>
weep and raised such a loud shriek as appeared to have taken away his life. Then Hazrat Omad said : If&nbsp;<br>
I do not tread the path on which my two predecessors, the Prophet and Abu Bakr, have treated, I would&nbsp;<br>
be destroyed and perish. By God, I would keep patience at the firm conduct of life, so that I may get&nbsp;<br>
eternal rest along with them.<br>
<br>
(17) The Prophet said: Some Prophets before me were tried by poverty. They had nothing but a wearing&nbsp;<br>
apparel. Some of them expired being bitten by lices. Even this was dearer to them than your wealth.<br>
A<br>
174	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	175<br>
(18) The Prophet said : When Moses came to a well at Madain, there appeared on his stomach the signs of&nbsp;<br>
vegetables owing to his thinness. The Prophets chose this way of life. They were most informed of the&nbsp;<br>
creations of God and more experienced of the path leading to success in the next world.<br>
(19) When this verse was revaled &quot;Those who hoard up gold and silver and don't spend them in the way of&nbsp;<br>
God etc.&quot; the Prophet said : May gold and silver be destroyed. We said : 0 Messenger of God. God&nbsp;<br>
prohibited us from hoarding gold and silver. Then what thing shall we hoard? The Prophet said Anyone of&nbsp;<br>
you shall take to remembering tongue, grateful heart and a chaste wife, so that they can help you in&nbsp;<br>
the affairs of your next world.<br>
(20) The Prophet said: God throws three disasters on a person who loves the world more than the next&nbsp;<br>
world. (1) He meets with such anxieties in mind as never go out of it, (2) He meets with such want as&nbsp;<br>
never go. (3) He has got such greed which is never satisfied.<br>
(21) The Prophet said : The faith of a man does not become perfect who does not love to remain&nbsp;<br>
unrecognized more than his greed to become known, and whose wish to get less does not become dearer&nbsp;<br>
than his greed to get more.<br>
(22) The Prophet Jesus Christ said : The world is like a bridge. Pass over it and don't make habitation&nbsp;<br>
on it. He was asked : 0 Prophet of God, if you had ordered us to construct houses of worship it would&nbsp;<br>
have been better. He said : Go and construct houses on that water. They said : how will the houses&nbsp;<br>
stand over water. He said : Then how will your worship remain in order having love of this world in&nbsp;<br>
mind.<br>
(23) Our Prophed said : My Lord presented before me the places of Mecca filled up with gold. I said : 0&nbsp;<br>
my Lord, I don't want it. What I want is that I should remain hungry one day and take food next day. I&nbsp;<br>
would pray to you on the day when I shall remain hungry and I would praise you and give you thanks on&nbsp;<br>
the day I would take food.<br>
(24) The Prophet said: One day the Prophet began to walk on foot with Gabriel with him. He ascended on&nbsp;<br>
a lofty place and said to Gabriel : 0 Gabriel, by one who sent you with truth, the family<br>
members of Muhammad could not have this evening one handful of wheat or maize. Hardly had he uttered&nbsp;<br>
it, he heard such a loud voice from heaven that caused his heart tremble. The Prophet said : Has God&nbsp;<br>
ordered for resurrection ? Gabriel said : That is not so. When he heard your voice. Israfil came to you&nbsp;<br>
and said : God sent me down with all the treausres of the world on bearing your complaint and to&nbsp;<br>
present them before you. If you wish, I would come to you with mountains of jewels, emeralds, gold and&nbsp;<br>
silver. Inform me whether you want to be Prophet with the kingdom of this vast world with all its seas&nbsp;<br>
or to be a Prophet and a servant. Gabriel hinted at the Prophet to be humble before God. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said thrice : I wish to become a Prophet and a servant.<br>
(25) The Prophet said : When God wishes good of a servant. He gives him renunciation of the world,&nbsp;<br>
desire for the next world and insight into his defects and sins.<br>
(26) He said : Take to world renunciation God will love you. He said : He who wishes that God should&nbsp;<br>
give him wisdom without education and guidance without a guide, should take recourse to world&nbsp;<br>
renunciation.<br>
(27) He also said : He who desires to go to Paradise, should hasten to good deed and he who fears Hell&nbsp;<br>
should restrain himself from passions. He who hopes for death, should give up pleasures. He who adopts&nbsp;<br>
renunciation in the world takes his dangers and difficulties easy.<br>
(28) Our Prophet and Jesus Christ said : Four things can be acquired with difficulty-(1) silence with&nbsp;<br>
primary divine service, (2) modesty. (3) excessive remembrance of God (4) and satisfaction with little.<br>
Sayings of the sages. A certain companion said : We have followed every action, but we found nothing&nbsp;<br>
more meritorious than world renunciation. (2) Hazrat Omar said : World renunciation brings peace of&nbsp;<br>
mind and body. Hazrat Wahab-bin-Monabbah said: Paradise has got eight-doors. When the dwellers of&nbsp;<br>
Paradise will be advancing towards those, the door-keepers will say : By the houour of our Lord, none&nbsp;<br>
shall enter Paradise except those who renounced the word and those who loved Paradise. The saint Eusof&nbsp;<br>
bin-Asbat said : I desire three virtues from God-(1) when death comes to me, I may not<br>
176	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
die possessing a single coin, (2) I leave no debt. (3) and there remains no flesh in my bones. God&nbsp;<br>
granted him these three things. The saint Amer-bin-Amir said : Jesus Christ used to wear woollen cloth&nbsp;<br>
and eat leaves and forages. He had no son to die and no house to be destroyed and he used not to hoard&nbsp;<br>
for to morrow. He used to sleep where his night came. The wife of saint Abu Hazem told him one day :&nbsp;<br>
The winter has come now and we required now food, cloth and fuel. Abu Hazem said to him These things&nbsp;<br>
are necessary no doubt, but more necessary are our death, resurrection, waiting before God for judgment&nbsp;<br>
and then entry into Paradise or Hell. Hazrat Ibrahim-bin-Adham said : We have covered over minds by&nbsp;<br>
three screens. Certain faith will not open them till the screens are removed-(1) to feel pleasure for&nbsp;<br>
the things in possession (2) to feel sorrow for not having something. (3) and to be delighted on&nbsp;<br>
hearing praises. If you feel pleasure for the things in possession at present you will be greedy. If&nbsp;<br>
you feel sorrow for the past things, you will be dissatisfied and for that you are to be punished. If&nbsp;<br>
you are delighted at hearing praises, you love self praise which destroys yourdivine service. Hazrat&nbsp;<br>
Ibn Masud said : Two rakats of prayer of a man who renounced the world is better than the divine&nbsp;<br>
service of an honest worker for his whole life and the former is dearer to God. A certain ancient sage&nbsp;<br>
said : The gifts of God that will come to us in future are grater than the past gifts of God on us. It&nbsp;<br>
seens that he said this looking at the following Hadis: Surely God saves His believing servant from&nbsp;<br>
attachment of the world as you save your patient from food and drink and fear these things for him.'&nbsp;<br>
When the patient understands this, he knows also that the gift of health is more valuable than the&nbsp;<br>
gifts from which he has been deprived. If they are given to him, his ailment will increase. The saint&nbsp;<br>
Sufiyan Saori said : The world is a temporary abode and not an eternal abode. This world is an abode of&nbsp;<br>
sorrow and not of happiness. He who knows it does not become satisfied with his fortune and&nbsp;<br>
dissatisfied with his misfortune. The saint Sahal Tastari said : The worship of a worshiper cannot turn&nbsp;<br>
out to be with sincere faith for God till he becomes free from four things-hunger, want of cloth,&nbsp;<br>
poverty and disgrace. The great saint Hasan Basari said : I saw many such persons and was associated&nbsp;<br>
with many such persons who did not become happy at the advent of wealth and sorrowful at its loss. It&nbsp;<br>
was more trivial thing to them than earth. Among them there were persons who lived up to 60 years&nbsp;<br>
without cloth to put on,<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	177<br>
without utensils for cooking, without bed for sleep and no order was placed for delicious food. When&nbsp;<br>
night came, they used to stand on their legs, prostrate over their faces, let tears to flow down their&nbsp;<br>
cheeks from their eyes and talk secretly with their Lord for their salvation. When they worshipped,&nbsp;<br>
they became humble in expressing gratefulness and prayed for its acceptance. When they committed sins,&nbsp;<br>
they became sad and prayed for forgiveness to God.. They remained always in that condition. By God,&nbsp;<br>
they were also not free from sin and got no salvation without God's forgivencess.<br>
THREE STAGES OF RENUNCIATION<br>
(1) First stage. This is the first and the lowest stage of renunciation. Such a man withholds his hand&nbsp;<br>
from a work which has got no connection with religion but cannot free himself completely from&nbsp;<br>
attachment of the world. He tries to keep his mind aloof from worldly things and makes such efforts.<br>
(2) Second stage. The scond and the middle stage of renunciation is like that of a man who gives up one&nbsp;<br>
coin for getting two, and he thinks that there is value of the coin he gives up, but still more&nbsp;<br>
valuable are the two coins he hopes to get in future.<br>
(3) Thrid stage. This stage of renunciation is highest as in this stage, a person gives up his world in&nbsp;<br>
preference to the next world, even he forgets renunciation as he takes the world as nothing. He is like&nbsp;<br>
a person who gives up coppet to get gold and does not think it a change.<br>
One Example. He who renunciates the world for the next is like a person (to a man experienced in&nbsp;<br>
spiritiual illumination', who meets with a dangerous dog in front of the royal palace. He throws a bit&nbsp;<br>
of bread before the dog which began to eat it. In the meantime, he enters the palace and takes up the&nbsp;<br>
affairs of administration in his hand as a minister. The devil is a dog in front of God's palace. Throw&nbsp;<br>
the world to him and enter the palace. If a man is given an age of one hundred years and abundant&nbsp;<br>
wealth and treasures of the world, these things are insignificant to him in comparison with the&nbsp;<br>
everlasting happiness of the next world, as a bit of bread is insignificant in comparison with an&nbsp;<br>
empire of the world. There can be no comparison of a thing which has got no end with that thing<br>
<br>
178	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
which has got an end. The world will end though it is prologed for thousands of years. Earthly pleasure&nbsp;<br>
can not be compared with the everlasting pleasures of the next world. Life is short and mixed up with&nbsp;<br>
pleasures and sorrows of this world. So where is its comaprison with the ever lasting happiness of the&nbsp;<br>
next world?<br>
<br>
There are also three classes of renunciation in consideration of getting something better. One class of&nbsp;<br>
renunciation is the lowest and that is the renunciation to save oneself from the punishment of Hell and&nbsp;<br>
other punishments such as severity of accounts, danger of bridge etc. The second class of renunciation&nbsp;<br>
is to get rewards of paradise, its pleasures and happiness. The third and the highest class of&nbsp;<br>
renunciation has gto no object except to meet with God and to get His pleasure. It is adopted neither&nbsp;<br>
to ward off punishment of Hell and other punishments, nor to get the pleasures and happiness of&nbsp;<br>
Paradise, but to get His love and pleasure. This is true Tauhid. He thinks that to do divine service&nbsp;<br>
except with the above motive is to set up partnership with God. This is the renunciation of the&nbsp;<br>
lovers-who are called Aref. Don't think that when the dwellers of Heaven will meet with their Lord, the&nbsp;<br>
thoughts of Hur, Gelman, buildings etc. will find any room in their minds.<br>
<br>
--Stages of renunciation in consideration of the things given up. (1) The first stage is that except&nbsp;<br>
God all things should be given up. (2) The second stage is to give up what helps passion. Such aperson&nbsp;<br>
gives up the necessary things of passion, such as greed, anger, pride, name and fame. (3) The third&nbsp;<br>
stage is to give up the causes of riches and name-and fame. (4) The fourth stage of renunciation is to&nbsp;<br>
give up learning, power, wealth and fame. If riches are increased, money is hoarded. If causes of fame&nbsp;<br>
increase, the object of knowledge and power becomes to captivate the minds of the people. The meaning&nbsp;<br>
of fame is to conquer the hearts of men and to spread lordship over them. God in one verse mentioned&nbsp;<br>
seven things of the world as endearing to men-women, echildren, boarded gold and silver, best horses,&nbsp;<br>
quardrupeds and corns and crops. These are the things of the world. God' also says : This world's life&nbsp;<br>
is nothing but pride in sports, adorments, mutual boast and increase of men and money. Then he says :&nbsp;<br>
For those who restrain themselves from passion,<br>
je<br>
'Paradise is their resort. In ohter words, the meaning of nunciation is to turn their minds from all&nbsp;<br>
pleasures of passion.<br>
Vol-N	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	179<br>
Whenever you turn your mind from the pleasures of self, you will then turn away from living forever in&nbsp;<br>
the world. Your hopes will 'then be short as the pleasures of the world are but short-lived. For this&nbsp;<br>
reason, when they were ordered to fight in the way of God, they cried out : 0 our Lord, we have been&nbsp;<br>
ordered to fight. If you give us a short time, it will be good. God says : say, the wealth of this&nbsp;<br>
world is very insignificant. At this time, those who renounced the world were recognised from those who&nbsp;<br>
were hypocrites. The former loved God and hence they stood like a solid rock in the way of God and&nbsp;<br>
wished to have the status of martyrs. Even Khalid-bin-Walid who died in his home said : I have played&nbsp;<br>
many times with my life, fought many battles to be a martyr, but to my ill luck I was not fovoured with&nbsp;<br>
martyrdom. Now I am dying aged like an ordinary man. When he died, eight hundred worunds were found in&nbsp;<br>
his body. Such was the condition of faith of the truthful.<br>
<br>
The hypocrites who fled from the battle field met with the following revelation : 'The death from which&nbsp;<br>
you flee away will surely overtake you. They preferred life to martyrodom, preferred a bad thing&nbsp;<br>
instead of a good one, misguidance in place of guidance. They did not make profit in their profession&nbsp;<br>
nor did they find guidance. As to those who did divine service with sincere mind, God purchased from&nbsp;<br>
them their lives and properties in exchange of Paradise. They received good news of everlasting&nbsp;<br>
happiness in exchange of their sacrifice of happiness of 20 or 30 years.<br>
<br>
These are the meanings of world renuhciation. The saint Wais Karni said : When a person of world&nbsp;<br>
renunciation comes out in search of something renunciation goes out from him. He also said : The&nbsp;<br>
meaning of renunciation is to give up search for something. He hinted at the search for livelihood. One&nbsp;<br>
expert in Hadis said : To work accoridng to one's free will is world. Renunciation is to follow&nbsp;<br>
knowledge and Prophet's Sunnah. The first of world-renunciation is to turn away from what is not usefu&nbsp;<br>
the next world. The saint Hasan Basri said : When a world unciator sees anybody, he says to him : You&nbsp;<br>
are better than myself. One sage said : Renunciation means to search for -lawful things. The saint&nbsp;<br>
Eusof-bin-Asbat said : He who is forbearing in sorrows and difficulties, gives up the coveted things&nbsp;<br>
and eats lawful food adopts the basis of renunciation. Thus there are different sayings of different&nbsp;<br>
sages. But the saint<br>
6<br>
180	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
Abu Solaiman Darani said : I heard many sayings of many sages<br>
about the meaning of renunciation, but the meaning of renunciation according to my opinion is to give&nbsp;<br>
up what keeps you away from God. Then he recited the verse : None but he who comes to God with a sound&nbsp;<br>
mind will get salvation-26: 89. He said that the meaning of sound mind is that mind which has got not&nbsp;<br>
thought excpet God. According to him renunciation can be classed into three-obligatory, optional and&nbsp;<br>
safe. Ibrahim-bin-Adham said : To take recourse to renunciation from unlawful things is obligatory,&nbsp;<br>
from greed of lawful things is optional and from doubtful things is safe. Imam Malek once was asked :&nbsp;<br>
What is renunciation. He said : Taqwa or God fear. There is renunciation regarding wealth and riches.&nbsp;<br>
There are different stages about them. The highest stage is the renunciation of Jesus Christ. He used&nbsp;<br>
once a piece of stone at pillow. The devil came to him and said : Have you renounced to world. Jesus&nbsp;<br>
Christ said What thing of the world have you found in me ? The devil said You have taken a stone under&nbsp;<br>
your head for comfort At this he cast off the stone and said: Take what I have thrown for you.<br>
It is said that Hazrat Ihya used to wear jute bag. By wearing thin and soft cloth, he might have felt&nbsp;<br>
joy and his passion satified. Some places of his body were wounded owing to use of rough bag. His&nbsp;<br>
mother saw this and adviced him to take robe of wool. When he did this, God revealed to him: 0 Yahya,&nbsp;<br>
you have preferred the world. He began to weep at this, threw off the woollen gown and again took to&nbsp;<br>
jute bag.<br>
The sage Ahmed said that the renunciation of Wais Karani was real. He used to sit in jute bag. 'Jesus&nbsp;<br>
Christ once enjoyed the shadow of the wall, of a person. When the owner of the wall removed him from&nbsp;<br>
that place, he said: You have not removed me .but God being dissatisfied removed me from this shade of&nbsp;<br>
your wall which I was enjoying.<br>
RENUNCIATION OF NECESSITIES OF LIFE: -The necessities of livelihood are limited, but the things which&nbsp;<br>
are not encessary are unlimited. So discusion of necessary things is necessary. There are six kinds of&nbsp;<br>
necessary things-(1) food. (2) cloth, (3) house, (4) furniture (5) wife, (6) wealth and honour.<br>
(1) Food: Lawful food is necessary for a man so as to keep his backbone erect, but it has got varieties&nbsp;<br>
and dimensions. To<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	181<br>
restrict them is renunciations. There are three stages of renunciation regarding time. The highest&nbsp;<br>
stage is to remain satisfied with that quantity of food which keeps the backbone erect. What he gets&nbsp;<br>
for day time, he does not store it up for the night. The second stage is to store food grains for 40&nbsp;<br>
days and the third stage is to store them for one year. Thosewho are weak in renunication-adopt this&nbsp;<br>
course. He who stores up food grains beyond one year can haredly be called one who renunciated the&nbsp;<br>
world<br>
<br>
Quantity food: The highest stage of renunciation regarding quantity is to eat one-fourth of a seer of&nbsp;<br>
food, the middle stage is half a seer and the lowest stage in one seer during the whole day and night.&nbsp;<br>
One seer (one Mud) has been fixed as expiation of sin to be given to a poor man. Beyond this, belly is&nbsp;<br>
worshipped.<br>
Kinds of food: The lowest stage regarding kind of food is bread of maize which is absolutely necessary&nbsp;<br>
for life. The middle kind is bread of wheat and other corns and the highest kind is bread of sifted&nbsp;<br>
wheat. Beyond this, there is luxury, such as bread of sifted flour, shuji etc. The lowest kind of curry&nbsp;<br>
is of vegetables with salt or condiment and the middle kind is with oil and edible things and the&nbsp;<br>
highest kind is with meat of all kinds, once or twice a week. If it-is continued for the whole week, it&nbsp;<br>
goes out of the last stage of renunciation.<br>
Time of food: The lowest stage of renunciation is to take food once only during the whole day and night&nbsp;<br>
which is nothing but fasting. The middle stage is to keep fast with a drink only at night or with food&nbsp;<br>
at night with no drink. The highes stage of renunication is to keep fast consequitively for three days&nbsp;<br>
or more.<br>
Habit of sages regarding quantity of food. Hazrat Ayesha said : There came a time upon us when for want&nbsp;<br>
of oil there was no light for 40 days in the house of the Prophet and for want of food there was no&nbsp;<br>
fire... She asked : With what thing would he then sustain his life ? Ayesha replied : With two black&nbsp;<br>
things-dried grape and water. It appears from this that he give up then meat and even vegtables. Hazrat&nbsp;<br>
Hasan Basri said : The Prophet used to ride on asses, wear coarse woollen cloth shoes, lick up his&nbsp;<br>
fingers after meal take meal on the ground and say : I am a mere slave. I take food just as a slave&nbsp;<br>
takes and sit just as a slave sits. Jesus Christ said : I speak to you with truth, he who<br>
182	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
seeks garden of Ferdous should take bread of husk and sleep<br>
with dogs in the neighbouring place. The saint Fart said that the Prophet after his arival at Medina&nbsp;<br>
could not eat bread of wheat consequitively for three days. Jesus Christ said: 0 the children of&nbsp;<br>
Israil, drink pure water and eat bread of maize and leave bread of wheat as you are unable to express&nbsp;<br>
gratefulness to Him. When the Prophet came to Qubba, the inhabitants came to him with drink of milk&nbsp;<br>
mixed with honey. He took the pot, threw it down and said : I don't make it unlawful but I leave it&nbsp;<br>
being modest of<br>
God.<br>
The sage Ibn Razi said : A true world renunciated man eats whatever he gets wears what covers his&nbsp;<br>
private parts and lives in a place wherever he gets. The world to him is a prison grave is his bed,&nbsp;<br>
loneliness is his companion, lesson is his thought, Quran is his object of discussion, Lord is his&nbsp;<br>
friend, renunciation is his companion, sorrow is his condition, shame is his sign, hunger is his curry,&nbsp;<br>
wisdom is his word, earth is his bed, God fear is his provision, silence is his jewel, patience is his&nbsp;<br>
hope, God-reliance is his attribute, intellect is his proof, divine service is his professirn and&nbsp;<br>
Paradise is his object-if God wishes.<br>
(2) Second necessary thing-cloth. The highest renunciation is to put on such cloth as protects heat and&nbsp;<br>
cold and. covers private parts. One piece of cloth is sufficient for cover. The middle stage of&nbsp;<br>
renunication is to put on one long shirt, one cap and one pair of shoes and the lowest state of&nbsp;<br>
renunciation is to put on the above things together with an handkerchief and one trouser. Beyond this,&nbsp;<br>
one goes out of renunciation. The condition of a world renounced man is that if he washes one cloth, he&nbsp;<br>
will not have a second piece to put on, rather he will sit within his room maked. When he has got two&nbsp;<br>
shirts, two trousers and two handkerchiefs, he goes out of the state of renunciation.<br>
KINDS OF CLOTH: The highest renunication is to put on coarse rag or jute, the middle stage is wool&nbsp;<br>
cloth and the lowest stage is coarse cotton cloth. Time of cloth. The world renounced man will put on&nbsp;<br>
such cloth as is durable for one day at least to one year at most. Even some of them put on leaves of&nbsp;<br>
trees to cover their private parts even though these leaves dry up. The middle course of duration is&nbsp;<br>
one month. The cloth which lasts for more than one year is against renunciation.<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	183<br>
Examples of the Prophet and his companions. Abu Bordah said that Hazrat Ayesha took out one blanket and&nbsp;<br>
one coar e wearing cloth and said that the Prophet expired within these tw clothes. The Prophet said :&nbsp;<br>
God loves the man who puts on what he gets and does not differentiate. He also said : God is&nbsp;<br>
dissatisfied with one who takes his dress for name and fame even though he is the beloved of God, till&nbsp;<br>
he takes it off. Once the Prophet purchasld a cloth costing four dirhams. His two clothes (wearing&nbsp;<br>
cloth and blanket) were valued at ten dirhams. His Tahband were four and half cubits long. He purchased&nbsp;<br>
once one Tahband for three dirhams. Sometimes he put on two white shamlas made of wool called gown.&nbsp;<br>
Sometimes he put on two clothes of the same kind. Sometimes he put on two course sheets made of Yemen.&nbsp;<br>
The Prophet had a long shirt. Once the Prophet put on a silk cloth of yellow colour made of Sandaush of&nbsp;<br>
the value of two hundred dirhams. The companions touched it and said with wonder : 0 Mesenger of God,&nbsp;<br>
this cloth has descended to you from Paradise. This dress was presented to the Prophet by the Emperor&nbsp;<br>
Mukaokis of Alexandria. He wished the Prophet to be dressed therewith. He put it on and then took it&nbsp;<br>
off and sent it to a non-believer with whom the Prophet had cordial relations. Thereafter he made silk&nbsp;<br>
dress unlawful. Once the Prophet put on a gold ring. Thereafter he put it off and made it unlwaful for&nbsp;<br>
males.<br>
<br>
Once. the Prophet put on a long shirt and said his prayer. After the prayer, he said : This cloth&nbsp;<br>
having embroidery turned away my mind. Take it to Abu Jaham, give it to him and take his blanket in its&nbsp;<br>
place for me. Once the laces of the shoes of the Prophet grew old and he took new laces and therewith&nbsp;<br>
he prayed. After the prayer, he said : Give me the old laces and put off the new ones, as during the&nbsp;<br>
prayers my attention was drawn towards the new laces. Once he put on a gold ring and began to deliver&nbsp;<br>
khutabah (sermon) on a pulpit. Suddenly his attention was drawn towards the ring. He put it off at once&nbsp;<br>
and said : I should not keep one eye towards the ring and one eye towards<br>
you.<br>
<br>
Once the Prophet was given a new pair of shoes. He was delighted at it and said in prostration : It&nbsp;<br>
appears to be good in my eyes. For this I feared and fell in prostration before my Lord. Then he came&nbsp;<br>
out with it and gave it to a poor man he found first<br>
184	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	185<br>
on the way. Once a long gown of leopard's skin was prepared or the Prophet. He put it on and said : How&nbsp;<br>
fine, how soft ! See to it. Then a wild Arab got up and said : 0 Messenger of God, gift it to me. He&nbsp;<br>
gifted it to him and ordered for a fresh gown. During its use, he died.<br>
Once the Prophet went to his daughter Fatema who was then turning round a grinding mill. He had then in&nbsp;<br>
his person a cloth made a camel's hairs. The Prophet saw this condition of Fatema and began to weep and&nbsp;<br>
said : 0 Fatema, you are having this suffering to be blessed with everlasting happiness. At once the&nbsp;<br>
revelation came : Soon your Lord will give you such things as you will be pleased therewith. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said : My highest Lord informed me about my people the pious among them will see the amount of&nbsp;<br>
the grace of God and will become glad openly and weep secretly fearing His punishment. Their burden on&nbsp;<br>
the people is light but their burden on them is heavy. They put on old cloths and follow those who have&nbsp;<br>
renunciated the world. Their bodies are in their world, but their minds keep near the Throne.<br>
<br>
These are the practices of the Prophet regarding dress. He lift instructions to his followers to follow&nbsp;<br>
him, as he said : He who loves me shall follow my ways of life. He also said : You should follow my&nbsp;<br>
ways and after me the ways of the rightly guided Caliphs. Hold it first with your front teeth. God said&nbsp;<br>
: Say, if you love God, follow me, God then will love you.<br>
<br>
The Prophet, gave Ayesha this special instruction : 0 Ayesha, if you like to stay with me, give up the&nbsp;<br>
assembly of the rich and don't leave a cloth until it is stitched. Twelve stitiches were found in the&nbsp;<br>
shirt of Hazrat Omar some of which were of hides. Once Hazrat Ali purchased a piece of cloth worth&nbsp;<br>
three dirhams. Its sleeves was long and therefore he tore it off and said: All praise is due to God who&nbsp;<br>
gave me to put it on out of kindness. The saint Sufiyan said : Put on such cloth as would not meet with&nbsp;<br>
disgrace from the learned and the ilitterate. He said : If any poor man passes by me while I pray, I&nbsp;<br>
think it my duty to pray for him. If at that time any worldly man passes by me with arms. I become&nbsp;<br>
displeased with him and I don't think it my duty to pray for him. An ancient sage said : Put on such&nbsp;<br>
cloth as therewith you can mix with the people in market and use not such cloth as atracts the&nbsp;<br>
attention of the people.<br>
The saint Abu Solaiman Darani said : There are three kinds of cloth-one kind of cloth is purely for God&nbsp;<br>
and that covers the private parts, one kind of cloth is for passion as passion wants soft cloth and&nbsp;<br>
another kind of cloth is for beauty of dress. Some sage said : The religion of one whose cloth is thin&nbsp;<br>
is also thin. Most of the Tabeyins used cloth of the value of 20 to 30 dirham. Special people used to&nbsp;<br>
wear only two cloths-one Tahband and one Pirhan. The Prophet said : To wear torn cloth is a sign of&nbsp;<br>
renunciation. He also said : It is the duty of God to store up the dress of emeralds of Paradise in a&nbsp;<br>
box for one who adopts modesty having had means and gives up fine dress to seek the pleasure of God.&nbsp;<br>
God revealed to one of the Prophets : Tell my friends not to wear the dress of my enemies, not to enter&nbsp;<br>
the paths of my enemies or else they will be my enemies like My enemies.<br>
<br>
Rafe bin Khadiz said when he found Bashar-bin-Merwan delivering a sermon on the pulput : Look to your&nbsp;<br>
ruler. He is delivering sermon to the people with the dress of sinners on his person. He put on thin&nbsp;<br>
fine dress. Once Abdulla-bin-Amer put on a valuable dress and was discussing with Abu Zarr about world&nbsp;<br>
renunciation. Abu Zarr put a whistle in this mouth and was making sound. At this, Ibn Amer got&nbsp;<br>
displeased and complained to Hazrat Omar who said : Have you advised him about renunciation putting on&nbsp;<br>
such valuable dress ? Hazrat Ali said : God took promise from the leaders of guides that they would&nbsp;<br>
live like ordinary men among the people, so that the rich people can follow them and do not hate, the&nbsp;<br>
poor for their poverty. When'a poor man was despised for his coarse cloth, he said : This is near&nbsp;<br>
modesty and more fit for the Muslims to follow. The Prophet prohibited grandeurs. He said; There are&nbsp;<br>
servants of God who do not love grandeurs. Fuzala- bin-Obaid was Governor of Egypt. He used to walk&nbsp;<br>
dishevelled in hairs and bare footed. He said that the Prophet had prohibited grandieur and gave&nbsp;<br>
instructions to walk sometimes bare footed. Hazrat Ali said to Hazrat Omar If you wish to stay with&nbsp;<br>
your two previous friends, stitch your shirt, make your wearing cloth short, stitch your sandals and&nbsp;<br>
eat not with satisfaction. Hazrat Omar said : Put on old coarse cloth and leave the dress of Persian&nbsp;<br>
and Byzantine empires. Hazrat Ali said : He who adopts the dress of another nation belongs to that&nbsp;<br>
nation. The Prophet said : The dishonest among my followers will eat delicious foods search for various&nbsp;<br>
kinds of foods and dresses and use ornamental languages in orations. The Prophet<br>
186	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	187<br>
said : The wearing apparel of a believer hangs upto half of lower leg and there is no harm in&nbsp;<br>
prolonging it to the space between half of lower leg and the joints. What hangs down beyond this is in&nbsp;<br>
the Hell fire. On the Resurrection Day. God will not look to one who prolongs his wearing apparel. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet also said : None but the fool among my followers will put on woollen cloths.<br>
Abu Solaiman said: When God adopted Hazrat Ibrahim as friend, He revealed to him ; Keep your private&nbsp;<br>
parts concealed more than earth. he used to keep only one piece of cloth except Tahband. He had two&nbsp;<br>
Tahband, when he washed one Tahband, he put on another so that he might not remain uncovered.<br>
Once Salman Faresi was asked: Why do you not put on good clothes? He said : Being a servant, how can I&nbsp;<br>
put on good clothes ? When I shall be free, God will give me such clothes as will never perish.<br>
(3) Another necessary thing is house. There are three stages also regarding houses to live in. The&nbsp;<br>
highest stage of renunciation regarding habitation is not to search a separate house to live in and to&nbsp;<br>
remain satisfied by taking recourse to a corner of a mosque. The middle stage is to seek a separate&nbsp;<br>
place for one's habitation, such as a room made of date leaves or straw or similar things. The lowest&nbsp;<br>
stage is to live in a house made of bricks or stones or hire such a house. If it is spacious according&nbsp;<br>
to need and has got no grandeur within, it does not go beyond the lowest stage of renunciation. If the&nbsp;<br>
house is spacious and fine and its terrace is higher than six cubits, he surpasses the limit of&nbsp;<br>
renunciation regarding house. In other words, there is renunciation if the limit of necessity is not&nbsp;<br>
surpassed. The man of religion is not to exceed the necessary limit of a thing. If it is crossed, it is&nbsp;<br>
against religion. A house is necessary for removing heat and cold, rain, eye-sight and difficulties.&nbsp;<br>
The lowest limit is known and the highest limit is not to exceed the limit and if limit is exceeded, it&nbsp;<br>
is included within the worldly things. The sages said that after the demise of the Prophet, what came&nbsp;<br>
open about long hope includes fineries of dress and construction of houses with bricks and such&nbsp;<br>
materials. The Prophet said : There will come a time upon the people when they will imprint upon their&nbsp;<br>
clothes like Yemeni shirts, Hazrat Abbas created a lofty house. The Prophet ordered it to be pulled&nbsp;<br>
down. One day while the Prophet was passing he found a dome in a house and said: Who<br>
has constructed this dome ? The people named the owner of this house to him. When the owner came, the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet did not look at him. When he asked his companion about the displeasure of the Prophet towards&nbsp;<br>
him, they gave him that information. Afterwards, the owner of the dome demolished the dome. One day the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet passed by that way and didnot find the dome and he was informed that the owner of the house had&nbsp;<br>
demolished it. At this the Prophet prayed for him.<br>
The saint Hasan Basari said: The Prophet did not place one brick upon another for habitation and one&nbsp;<br>
piece of wood upon another. The Prophet said : When God wishes evil for a servant, He destroys his&nbsp;<br>
wealth in water and earth. Abdullah-bin-Amr said : We were once engaged in repairing a worn out house.&nbsp;<br>
At that time the Messenger of God was passing by that way and asked us : What are you doing ? We said :&nbsp;<br>
This house is about to fall down and so we are repairing it. He said : Death is faster than this.<br>
The Prophet Noah was constructing a house of reeds. He was told : It would have been better if you have&nbsp;<br>
prepared a house of bricks. He said : For one who is subject to death, this house of reed is&nbsp;<br>
sufficient. The Prophet said : He who makes his house high without necessity, will be asked to bear its&nbsp;<br>
burden. The Prophet said; A man will get rewards for what he spends but he will not get any reward for&nbsp;<br>
what he spends in water and earth. God says : This is the abode of the Hereafter. I have prepared it&nbsp;<br>
for those who do not want in the world to be high or create disturbances. This means search for powers&nbsp;<br>
and construction of lofty places. The Prophet said : Every building will be an instrument of punishment&nbsp;<br>
on the Resurrection Day for its owner, but it will not be an instrument of punishment if it gives&nbsp;<br>
protection from heat and cold. When a man complained of the inspacious house of the Prophet, he told&nbsp;<br>
him : Increase its spaciousness in sky or Paradise.<br>
At the time of going to Syria, Hazrat Omar saw a lofty building and after reciting Takbir he said : I&nbsp;<br>
did not think before that any man of this people will construct a building like that of Haman, minister&nbsp;<br>
of Pharaoh. Paraoh said: 0 Haman, burn bricks for me. It is said that Pharaoh. was the first man who&nbsp;<br>
constructed a building made of bricks and Haman was the first man to construct of lofty building.&nbsp;<br>
Thereafter the tyrant kings followed him.<br>
188	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
A certain sage of yore saw a mosque in a town and said: I saw the mosque being constructed by branches&nbsp;<br>
of dried palm leave and then by earth and then by bricks. There were some men who, at the time of going&nbsp;<br>
for pilgrimage or for joining Jihad, broke their houses and gifted them to their neighbours. When they&nbsp;<br>
came back, they used to construct their houses anew. Their houses were made of grass or hide and their&nbsp;<br>
height was equal to that of a man. Hazrat Hasan Basari said : When we entered the hut of the Prophet,&nbsp;<br>
we could touch its roof. Amr-bin-Dinar said : When a man makes his roof higher than six cubits, an&nbsp;<br>
angel proclaims : 0 sinner, where are you going ? The saint Sufiyan Saori prohibited looking at lofty&nbsp;<br>
buildings. He said : If the people did not cast their lock, they would not have constructed lofty&nbsp;<br>
buildings. If one looks at them, it helps that. Thesage Fazil said He who crests a building for&nbsp;<br>
habitation and then dies is not a greater wonder to me than one who sees it and does not take care.&nbsp;<br>
Hairat Ibn Masud said : A party of men will appear who will erect earth above, keep their religion low&nbsp;<br>
and use unchaste women. They will pray towards your Qibla but they will die on a religion other than&nbsp;<br>
yours.<br>
(4) Another necessary thing-Furnitures of Household. The highest sage of renunciation regarding this is&nbsp;<br>
that of Jesus Christ. He used to keep only one comb and one pot with him. One day he saw a man combing&nbsp;<br>
his beard with his fingers and he at once threw off his comb. He saw another man drinking water of the&nbsp;<br>
river, with his hand and so he threw off his pot also. Such is the rule with regard to everything as a&nbsp;<br>
thing is used for some purpose. When that thing is not required, it returns, to him as a sort of&nbsp;<br>
punishment both in this world and the world next. What is absolutely necessary for him is kept within&nbsp;<br>
the lowest limit just as the earthen pot. The middle stage is that everything is lawful according to&nbsp;<br>
needs but that is kept by one piece which serves many purposes. If there is only one cup, he eats&nbsp;<br>
therein and drinks therefrom. The early sages used the same thing for different purposes. If things are&nbsp;<br>
kept in large numbers and are also valuable, the man goes out of the limit of renunciation.<br>
<br>
Prophet's renunciation. Hazrat Ayesha said : The bed on which the Prophet used to sleep contained a&nbsp;<br>
pillow full of refuges of drifted dried grapes within skin. Fazil said: His bed was prepared of the&nbsp;<br>
sheet which he put on when it was folded twice and his<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	189<br>
pillow was filled up with refuges of grapes covered with skin. Once Hazrat Omar went to the Prophet ad&nbsp;<br>
saw him sleeping on a chatai mixed with dust. When the Prophet rose up from sleep, he saw prints of&nbsp;<br>
chatai on his both sides and began to weep. The Messenger of God asked him : 0 son of Khattab, why are&nbsp;<br>
you weeping ? Hazrat Omar said : 0 Messenger of God, the emperors of Byzantium and Persia are engaged&nbsp;<br>
in endless happiness though they are enemies of God, but you are the friend of God, His messenger and&nbsp;<br>
chosen servant, You are lying on this cahtai mixed with dust? The Prophet said : 0 Omar are you not&nbsp;<br>
satisfied that the grandeur of this world is for them and the grandeur of the next world is for us ?&nbsp;<br>
Hazrat Omar said: 0 Messenger of God, that is true. The Prophet said : What I said is also true.<br>
<br>
Once a man went to Abu Zarr and began to look at his house. Then he said : 0 Abu Zarr, I don't find any&nbsp;<br>
house-hold goods in your house. What is the reason? He said: I have got a house (next world) where I&nbsp;<br>
send every good thing. He said : So long as you are in this house, you should keep some goods here. He&nbsp;<br>
said : The owner of this house will not allow me to live here further. Omarbin-Sayeed, Governor of&nbsp;<br>
Hems, once came to see Omar who asked him : What properties of the world are in your house ? He said :&nbsp;<br>
I have got a stick by which I walk and kill any serpent I met with. I have got a bag wherein I keep my&nbsp;<br>
eatable things. I have got another cup wherein I eat and wherewith I wash my head and cloth. I have got&nbsp;<br>
a badna to make ablution. I carry water therein for drinking and for making ablution. The things beyond&nbsp;<br>
these are included within worldly things. Wherever Igo I take these things with me. At this Hazrat Omar&nbsp;<br>
said : You have spoken the truth. May God shower His blessings on you.<br>
<br>
Once the Prophet returned from a long journey, went to Hazrat Fatema's house and found a screen of&nbsp;<br>
varied colours hanging at her door. Fatema was then wearing two pieces of bangles of silver. Seeing&nbsp;<br>
this, the Prophet went away from that place without uttering a single word. Hazrat Abu Rafe afterwards&nbsp;<br>
went to Fatema and found her weeping. She told Abu Rafe all details and the latter asked her : Has he&nbsp;<br>
returned only after seeing one screen and two bangles ? Hazrat Fatema sent Bilal with these two things&nbsp;<br>
and asked the Prophet that she was willing to make gift of these two things and that he might give them&nbsp;<br>
to whomever he would like. He said : Sell these things and<br>
190	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
makes the price of gift to the companions of Suffa. He sold the two bangles for 21/2 dirhams and gifted&nbsp;<br>
it to them. Then the Prophet went to Fatema and said By my father you have done well.<br>
Once the Prophet saw a screen in the door of Hazrat Ayesha's room. He looked at it and said : Whenever&nbsp;<br>
I see it, it reminds me of the world. Send it to the family of so and so. One night Hazrat Ayesha&nbsp;<br>
prepared a new bed for the Prophet. Before this he used to make his sheet two fold and sleep thereon.&nbsp;<br>
In that night, he only changed sides and could not sleep. At dawn, the Prophet said to Ayesha : Spread&nbsp;<br>
out my old sheet and take this bed from me. It kept me all night awake. In this way, the Prophet passed&nbsp;<br>
another sleepless night when he got at that time five or six dinars. In the latter part of the night,&nbsp;<br>
he took them and gifted them away. Hazrat Ayesha said : He then slept such a deep sleep that I could&nbsp;<br>
hear the sound of his nose. When he got up from sleep, he said : If I met God storing up these coins,&nbsp;<br>
what He would have thought of Muhammad?<br>
Hazrat Hasan Basari said : I saw ten companions, each of whom had only once cloth and had no cloth to&nbsp;<br>
spread on the earth for sleep. Whenever any one of them wished to sleep, he placed his back on the&nbsp;<br>
ground, placed cloth on his person and slept.<br>
(5) Another necessary thing-Marriage. Many persons say that if one person gets married or takes several&nbsp;<br>
wives, he goes out of the limit of renunciation. The Prophet was the greatest of saints and yet he&nbsp;<br>
loved wives. Shall we then go without marriage? The saint Aynah supported this. He said: that Hazrat&nbsp;<br>
Ali was the greatest among the companions but he had four wives and twelve slave girls. To us, what the&nbsp;<br>
saint Abu Solaiman Darani said is the correct opinion. He said : Whatever thing keeps your mind turned&nbsp;<br>
away from God-properties and children, is the sign of your misfortune. When women keep your mind away&nbsp;<br>
from God. It is better then to remain unmarried. Not to marry then is included within renunciation. But&nbsp;<br>
when passion runs high, to marry is compulsory. If you do not then marry, it will not be renunciation.&nbsp;<br>
If one knows that his wife not keep his mind turned away from the remembrance of God, it does not go&nbsp;<br>
out of renunciation, as the object of marriage is the birth of children and preservation of human&nbsp;<br>
species. By this, merits are acquired for increasing also the followers of the Prophet. A<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	191<br>
bachelor is like one who gives up food and drink fearing them. That is not renunciation, as to give up&nbsp;<br>
food and drink means destruction of body. Similarly, to give up marriage is not renunciation as it will&nbsp;<br>
not preserve his dynasty. So to give up marriage for forsaking conjugal joy is not renunciation. If you&nbsp;<br>
fear to remain busy in case of marriage of several wives, then marry only one. The saint Abu Solaiman&nbsp;<br>
said : There is also renunciation is marriage. That is to marry orphan girls or ugly girls and not to&nbsp;<br>
marry beautiful and respectable girls. The saint Junaid said : I like three preliminary things for a&nbsp;<br>
traveller towards religion-(1) to carry on some trade, (2) to search for Hadis and (3) to marry.<br>
(6) Another necessary thing-Wealth and honour. Honour is obtained by capturing the minds of the people&nbsp;<br>
and with the help of honour, a man attains his object.<br>
WEALTH-Limited wealth is necessary for livelihood. The earning man should give up earning if he has got&nbsp;<br>
necessary things for a day. This is the condition of renunciation. If one crosses this limit, he&nbsp;<br>
suspasses the ways of the Prophet and goes out of the lowest stage of renunciation. If he has got&nbsp;<br>
landed properties and has got no such strength as to rely on God, he may hoard for one year his&nbsp;<br>
necessary things and by this act he will not go out of renunciation. If he does not make a gift of the&nbsp;<br>
surplus things keeping the yearly things of necessity, he will be the weakest person in renunciation.&nbsp;<br>
The condition of renunciation is a personal affair but it is not a duty to be imposed upon family&nbsp;<br>
members. It is true that one should not surpass the middle course. The Prophet went out of Fatema's&nbsp;<br>
house seeing her screen of varied colours and her bangles, as these were adornments, not necessary&nbsp;<br>
things. Wealth and honour in necessary measure are not prohibited and what is beyond necessary things&nbsp;<br>
regarding wealth and honour is like poison and therefore injurious. Wealth and honour to ward off wants&nbsp;<br>
are not worldly things but are included within the next worldly things.<br>
Once the Prophet Abraham fell in want and wanted loan from one of his friends, but he did not give him&nbsp;<br>
loan. God then sent revelation to him: If you wanted it from your Friend; He would have surely given it&nbsp;<br>
to you. He said : 0 my Lord, I know that you do not love the world. I feared for that reason to invoke&nbsp;<br>
you for that. God revealed to him: 'The thing which is necessary<br>
192	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
is not world.' So what is absolutely necessary is included within religion, but there is punishment in&nbsp;<br>
the next world for what is not necessary and that is the world. He who looks at the condition of a rich&nbsp;<br>
man and the disgrace of earning money and its hoarding and preservation, can know the punishment of&nbsp;<br>
wealth in this world. The least misfortune of the rich is that they leave these riches behind for their&nbsp;<br>
heirs. In most cases, their riches help them in the commission of sins. Therefore the hoarders in the&nbsp;<br>
world have been compared to the worms of silk. These silk worms weave over their bodies first and do&nbsp;<br>
not find any way out of them and for that they die and perish owing to their actions. He who is busy&nbsp;<br>
with the world is exactly like that. He is confined by his riches, name and fame, family, children,&nbsp;<br>
pleasure of his enemies and displeasure of his friends and other things of the world. If he wants to go&nbsp;<br>
out of the world, he can't do it and finds himself confined. If any dear thing goes out of his hand, he&nbsp;<br>
as it were meets with death. Thereafter the angel of death one day separates him completely from his&nbsp;<br>
dear things. He snatches him catching hold of the sinews of his heart but the dear things of the world&nbsp;<br>
draw him towards the world. If he dies in such a condition, he becomes like a person whose body is&nbsp;<br>
split up by saw. Hazrat Hasan Basri said : I saw 70 soldiers of Bad. They renunciated lawful things&nbsp;<br>
more than what you renunciated from unlawful things. In another narration : They enjoyed more happiness&nbsp;<br>
in their disasters than what you enjoy in your solvency and sufficient means. If you had seen this, you&nbsp;<br>
would have termed them mad. If they had seen your pious men, they would have said : These people have&nbsp;<br>
got no connection with religion. If they had seen your sinners, they would have said : They have got no&nbsp;<br>
faith in the judgment day. If any lawful thing reached any one of them he did not accept it and said :&nbsp;<br>
I fear the destruction of my heart. He who had heart feared the spoiling of his heart. God gave&nbsp;<br>
information about those whose hearts have been spoiled by the attachment of the world : They are&nbsp;<br>
satisfied with this world's life and are heedless of My orders. God says : Don't obey those who have&nbsp;<br>
made their hearts heedless of Us and followed their low desires. God said : Turn away from those who&nbsp;<br>
turn away from My remembrance and who don't wish but this world's life. The run of their wisdom is&nbsp;<br>
this.<br>
<br>
Once a man said to Jesus Christ : Take me as your companion in your jourey. Jesus Christ said : Gift&nbsp;<br>
your wealth<br>
Vol-IV	POVERTY AND RENUNCIATION	193<br>
and then come to me. He said : I can't do it. Jesus Christ said : It is a wonder for a rich man to&nbsp;<br>
enter Paradise. A certain sage said : At the time of sun-rise four angels, two in the east and two in&nbsp;<br>
the west, proclaim every day by four different proclamations. One angel in the west proclaims : 0&nbsp;<br>
seeker of God, go forward. 0 seeker of evil, stop. Another angle says : 0 God, give good rewards to the&nbsp;<br>
charitable man and destroy the miser. One angel in the east says : Birth is for death and building is&nbsp;<br>
for destruction. Another angel says : Eat with satisfaction for heavy account and enjoy.<br>
<br>
SIGNS OF RENUNCIATION: There are three internal signs of renunciation-(1) Not to be delighted for the&nbsp;<br>
things in present possession and not to be sorry for what is not in possession. God says : In order&nbsp;<br>
that you may not be grieved for what missed you and not be joyful for what you have got.' Rather you&nbsp;<br>
should do the opposite. Be sorry for having possessed wealth and be delightful for not having possessed&nbsp;<br>
it. (2) The second sign of renunciation is that to him, his praiser and defamer are equal. He does not&nbsp;<br>
feel delighted if he hears his praise, and sorry if he is defamed. (3) The third sign of renunciation&nbsp;<br>
is to establish love with God and make divine worship predominant in mind. The love for this world and&nbsp;<br>
love for God are two things which are like water and air in a pot. When there is water in a pot, air&nbsp;<br>
goes out as these can not remain together, He who establishes love with God remains engaged in that and&nbsp;<br>
turns away from other works. For this reason, some sage was asked : How far has renunciation taken you&nbsp;<br>
? He said : Up to the love of God. Love of God and love of the world can not remain together. A person&nbsp;<br>
of Marfat said When faith has connection with the outer surface of mind he loves both this world and&nbsp;<br>
the world next and works for both. When faith stays within the innermost heart, he hates the world and&nbsp;<br>
does not work for the world. For this reason, Hazrat Adam prayed : 0 God, I seek from you such faith as&nbsp;<br>
remains in the innermost recess of my heart. The saint Abu Solaiman ,,aid : He who is busy with&nbsp;<br>
himself, keeps away from human society. This is the stage of Arefin. Ibn Hawari said : I asked Ibn&nbsp;<br>
Solaiman Was Daud Tai a worldly renounced man ? He said : Yes, he was I said : I heard that he&nbsp;<br>
inherited from his a father twenty dinars which he spent during 20 years. When he hoarded the dinars&nbsp;<br>
how was he a worldly renounced man ? He said : You think that he reached the limit of perfect&nbsp;<br>
renunciation, but there is no limit to<br>
194	THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES Vol-IV<br>
renunciation. A man has got multifold natures and renunciation<br>
is not complete till he is free from those natures. The last limit of renunciation is to give up&nbsp;<br>
everything except God, such a person<br>
will not use even a stone as pillow as Jesus Christ did. So the sign of renunciation is that poverty&nbsp;<br>
and solvency, honour and dishonour, praise and defamation are all the same to him. This is the result&nbsp;<br>
of predominance of God's love in a person. Ihya-bin-Moaz said : To gift away what is in possession is&nbsp;<br>
the sign of renunciation. Ibn-Khafif said : I one finds peace of mind on the loss of a thing, it is the&nbsp;<br>
sign of this renunciation. Abu Solaiman said : Sufi cloth is one of the signs of renunciation. Sufiyan&nbsp;<br>
said : Little hope is the sign of renunciation. Nasrabazi said : A worldly renounced man is a sojourner&nbsp;<br>
in the world and an Aref is a sojouner of the next world. Ihya-bin-Moaz said : There ar three signs of&nbsp;<br>
renunciation (1) to work without connection, (2) to talks without greed (3) and to seek honour without&nbsp;<br>
power. He said : He who adopts renunciation gives you smell of condiment and mustard oil, but an Aref&nbsp;<br>
or gnostic gives you smell of camphor and otto. A man asked them : When shall I enter the shop of&nbsp;<br>
Godreliance, wear the apparel of renunciation add keep company with the worldly renounced men ? He said&nbsp;<br>
To sit with them is foolishness till you reach to stage when your belief of certainty does not become&nbsp;<br>
weak if your provision for three days is cut off. He said : The world is like a newly married girl. She&nbsp;<br>
goes with one who wants her. He who renounces the world makes his face black, shaves hairs and wears&nbsp;<br>
torn cloths, but a gnostic remains busy with God and does not do these things. The saint Sarri Sakti&nbsp;<br>
said : I travelled all the ways of renunciation. I got from it what I wanted but I could not earn&nbsp;<br>
renunciation living in the society of men. The sage Fazl said : God kept all the evils together in a&nbsp;<br>
house and made its key the love of the world. He placed all good in a house and made its key world&nbsp;<br>
renunciation.<br>

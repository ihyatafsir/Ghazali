CHAPTER V<br>
TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL<br>
Tawakkal-or God reliance is a stage of religion and a state of progress of the believers. Rather it is&nbsp;<br>
the highest state of those who are near God. The knowledge about God reliance is very subtle and the&nbsp;<br>
cause of it is that if one looks at the causes and ingredients of an action, he sets up partnership&nbsp;<br>
with God. In other words, if a man believes that anything has got power over the actions of a man, he&nbsp;<br>
can't be counted as a true monotheist. On the other hand, if the intermediary causes are deducted, it&nbsp;<br>
is casting aspersion on the Prophet's ways and dishonour on Shariat. If one disbelieves the causes of&nbsp;<br>
an action there is misuse of intellect and as such one is drowned in the abyss of ignorance. so the&nbsp;<br>
real meaning of God-reliance is every subtle. The meaning of God reliance is intellect Shariat and&nbsp;<br>
Tauhid, the intermingling of three elements in a proportionate manner.<br>
<br>
MERITS OF GOD-RELIANCE<br>
Quran : If you are believers rely on God-5 : 23. God says Persons of God reliance rely on God. (3) God&nbsp;<br>
says : God is sufficient for one who rely on God-3: 65. (4) God says : Surely God loves those who rely&nbsp;<br>
on Him-3: 159. He who reaches this stage is loved by God who is his surety. God protects one for whom&nbsp;<br>
God is surety. He loves him and protects him. (5) God says<br>
Is not God sufficient for His servant ? He who searches for sufficiency from other than God has got no&nbsp;<br>
reliance on God and knows the above verse as false as this verse was questioned for reply with truth.&nbsp;<br>
(6) God says : Has not a time come over a man when he was not a thing to be mentioned ? (7) God says :&nbsp;<br>
He who relies on God, God is most powerful and wise. He is so powerful that He does not put one to&nbsp;<br>
disgrace who comes to His refuge and He does not destroy him who comes to His care. He is so just that&nbsp;<br>
he who relies on Him does no reduce or destroy his efforts. (8) God says : What you worship besides God&nbsp;<br>
is mere servants like You. In other words, all things other than God have got needs like you. (9) God&nbsp;<br>
says : What you worship besides God has got no power to give you sustenance. So search sustenance from&nbsp;<br>
God and worship Him only. (10) God says : All hidden treasures of heaven and earth are only for God,&nbsp;<br>
but the hypocrites do not<br>
196<br>
TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	197<br>
understand. (11) God says : He conducts every affair and nobody intercedes except with His permission.<br>
Hadis-(1) The Prophet said : I saw all of my followers at the time of pilgrimage. I saw my followers&nbsp;<br>
filling up all plains and mountains. I was asked : Are you satisfied. I said : Only 70,000 Muslims will&nbsp;<br>
go to Paradise without account even though their numbers are many. He was asked : 0 Messenger of God,&nbsp;<br>
who are they? He said : They are those who do no work looking at good or bad signs, who don't rely on&nbsp;<br>
spells and charms and rely only on their Lord. The companion Okasha stood up and said : 0 Messenger of&nbsp;<br>
God pray so that I may be one of them. The Prophet said : 0 God, make him one of them. Another&nbsp;<br>
companion stood up and said : Pray so that my be one of them. The Prophet said Okasha kept you behind&nbsp;<br>
and went forward. (2) The Prophet said If you can rely on God with due reliance. He will provide you&nbsp;<br>
with sustenance in such a manner as He provides birds and beasts. They leave their nests early in the&nbsp;<br>
morning and return in the evening filling up their bellies. (3) The Prophets said : He who returns to&nbsp;<br>
God after cutting off all connections, God is sufficient for him in his every action and He provides&nbsp;<br>
him from such a source which is beyond his conception. He who is addieted to the world, God hands him&nbsp;<br>
over to the world, (4) The Prophet said He who is pleased in not depending on men should hold fast more&nbsp;<br>
to what is near God than what is near men. (5) It has been narrated that when the family members of the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet became, hungry, he used to say : Stand up for prayer. He used to say : My Lord ordered me only&nbsp;<br>
for this, God says : Enjoing family members for prayer and stand steadfast to it. (6) The Prophet said&nbsp;<br>
He who takes refuge to enchantment and charms does not rely on God. (7) It has been narrated that when&nbsp;<br>
the Prophet Abraham was thrown into the fire, Gabriel said to him: Have you got any necessity ? He said&nbsp;<br>
: I have got no necessity from you God's word is sufficient : God is sufficient for me and how good is&nbsp;<br>
He as an object of refuge, when arrangements were being made to throw him into fire, he informed&nbsp;<br>
Gabriel of this. God then sent to him revelation : Abraham is he who fulfilled his promise-53 : 37. (8)&nbsp;<br>
God revealed to David, 0 David, there is no such a man who seeks refuge to Me after forsaking the&nbsp;<br>
refuges of all men that I will not find out a way to save him even though all in heaven and earth stand&nbsp;<br>
against him.<br>
Sayings of sages. Sayeed-bin-Zubair : One scorpion stung me. My mother took oath from me that l must go&nbsp;<br>
to a charmer and heal myself. I stretched out my hand which was not stung to the charmer. Ibrahim&nbsp;<br>
Khawas read this verse : Rely on One who is ever-living and who will not die. He said : Is there any&nbsp;<br>
refuge to men after this verse ? (2) Some one said to a sage in his dream : He who relies firmly on God&nbsp;<br>
seeks his own sustenance. (3) A certain sage said : Search for livelihood should not divert you from&nbsp;<br>
compulsory duties or else the affairs of your next world will be spoiled. You will not get wealth&nbsp;<br>
except what has been destined for you. (4) Ihya-bin-Muaz said : When sustenance comes to a man without&nbsp;<br>
asking, it is a proof that sustenance gets orders to search for man. (5) Hazrat Ibrahim-bin-Adham said:&nbsp;<br>
I asked a certain Christian monk : Wherefrom do you get your livelihood ? He said : It is not known to&nbsp;<br>
me, but I ask my Lord wherefrom He gives my provision. (6) Hasan-bin-Haram asked the saint Wais Qarni :&nbsp;<br>
In which country do you order me to live? He hinted at Syria, Ibn-Haram said : How shall I earn my&nbsp;<br>
livelihood there ? Wais Qarni said : Alas for one who has got doubt in mind and who does not get any&nbsp;<br>
benefit from advice. (7) A certain sage said : When I am satisfied with God as agent, I got guidance to&nbsp;<br>
all good.<br>
<br>
WHAT IS TAUHID? Know 0 readers, that God-reliance is a door out of the doors of faith. All the doors of&nbsp;<br>
faith are not kept in order except with knowledge, condition and action. Out of these three elements,&nbsp;<br>
God-reliance is born. Knowledge is the basis, action is its fruit. Another name of conditions is God&nbsp;<br>
reliance. It is called faith in, dictionary, as the meaning of faith is corroboration. What is&nbsp;<br>
corroborated by heart is called knowledge. If it is firm, it is called certainly of faith or sure&nbsp;<br>
faith. It has got many doors, but it is placed on two doors-(1) Tauhid and God reliance.<br>
<br>
TAUHID MEANS- (1) To believe that there is no deity but God, He is one, there is no partner for him,&nbsp;<br>
(2) to believe in His power and (3) to believe in His kindness and skill. The faith of one is perfect&nbsp;<br>
who believes that there is no deity but God, He is one, there is no partner for Him, there is His&nbsp;<br>
sovereignty, all praise is due to Him, He is powerful over all things. This is the basis of God&nbsp;<br>
reliance. In other words, Tauhid is a vast ocean which has got no limit.<br>
198	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
FOUR STAGES Of TAUHID; The first stage is like outer<br>
cover of a coconut, the second stage is the inner cover of a<br>
coconut, the third stage is the kernel of a coconut and the fourth<br>
stage is the oil of the kernel. The first stage of Tauhid is to utter by<br>
tongue &quot;There is no deity but God&quot;. The second stage is to confirm it by heart. The third stage is like&nbsp;<br>
kernel which can be seen by inner light or by way of Kashf. This is the stage of those who are near&nbsp;<br>
God. The fourth stage is like oil in kernel. He sees nothing but God. This is the stage of the truthful&nbsp;<br>
or it is called Fana-fi-Tauhid or to lose oneself in Tauhid. Even he forgets himself. In the first&nbsp;<br>
stage, a man is saved from sword by uttering only Kalima Tauhid. In the second stage, he believes the&nbsp;<br>
internal meaning. Such a class of the faithful are saved front e punishment of the next world. In the&nbsp;<br>
third stage, he sees nobody except God as the cause of action and the fourth stage is the utmost limit&nbsp;<br>
of Tauhid. In the second stage, breast is expanded by the light of Islam as God says. God expands the&nbsp;<br>
breasts of one for Islam whom I-Ie wants to guide. God says : He whose breast God expands for Islam&nbsp;<br>
remains upon light from his Loard.<br>
<br>
Question. How can one in the highest stage not see but One, the source of all actions, while he sees&nbsp;<br>
the heaven and earth and all the things of the material world ? How can one become many?<br>
<br>
Answer. Know, 0 dear readers that this affair appertains to the secret mysteries of the spiritual world&nbsp;<br>
and it is not allowed to write these secrets. Arefs said that to disclose God's secrets is infidelity&nbsp;<br>
and there is no connection of worldly knowledge with them. It is true that in the preliminary&nbsp;<br>
observation it is difficult to know many as one, but it is possible to explain them. The same thing&nbsp;<br>
becomes many things from one consideration and becomes one from another consideration. Body, life,&nbsp;<br>
hands, feet, bones etc., if looked at separately become many things of the same man and if looked froth&nbsp;<br>
another angle becomes one man composed of many thins. There are many person who see the same one man&nbsp;<br>
but do not think of his different organs at that time. The difference between these two things is that&nbsp;<br>
he thinks that he saw the whole man if he sees the face only of a drowning than. So only sight of an&nbsp;<br>
organ leads one to think that he saw the whole. man, Similarly is the case of the Creator and the&nbsp;<br>
created. They appear in many forms. One one consideration, they are one and on another consideration&nbsp;<br>
they are many.<br>
Vol-IV THE 1300K OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	199<br>
The first 'stage of Tauhid is not absolved from hypocrisy and<br>
the name of the second stage is faith which is current among<br>
ordinary Muslims. The basis of God-reliance is established upon the third state of Tauhid, as mere&nbsp;<br>
faith in Tauhid cannot bring the condition of God-reliance. In this stage there is belief that except&nbsp;<br>
God, there is no doer of actions. God created creation provision, wealth good and bad, life and death,&nbsp;<br>
poverty and solvency, He has got no partner. When it is clear to you, you will not look towards others.&nbsp;<br>
Rather you will fear Him, hope in Him, have faith in Him and rely on Him as He is singular in actions&nbsp;<br>
and everything besides God is subject to His discipline. You have got no authority to change an atom of&nbsp;<br>
the creation of God. When the doors of spiritual kingdom will be opened to you it will be clear to you,&nbsp;<br>
more clear than external eye sight.<br>
<br>
The devil turns you from this stage of Tauhid to such a place where you have got doubts for two&nbsp;<br>
reasons. The first reason is to look at the freedom of will of man and the second reason is to look to&nbsp;<br>
the lifeless things, as you look to the fall of rain for growth of corns or crops, hope for rain from&nbsp;<br>
clouds and hope fro wind for plying of boats. In these things, there is setting up of Shirk or&nbsp;<br>
partnership with God. For this reason, God says : When they get on board a boat, they invoke God with&nbsp;<br>
sincere heart, but when He takes them to the shore, they set up Shirk. This means that they say : If&nbsp;<br>
the velocity of hurricanes would not have come to a stand still, we would not have been saved.<br>
<br>
He who knows the secrets, knows that the hurricane is nothing but a terrible wind conducted by One who&nbsp;<br>
has got control over everything. So if one considers wind as the cause of deliverance. He is like one&nbsp;<br>
who was arrested for murder but the 'king sent a letter pardoning him. The arrested man remembers pen&nbsp;<br>
ink and paper as the causes of his deliverance and says : Had not been these elements. I would not have&nbsp;<br>
been saved. So he considers these things as the causes of his safety. This is utter foolishness. He who&nbsp;<br>
knows that these things have got no independent will and that these things have been made subservient&nbsp;<br>
to the writer does not consider these elements as the causes of his deliverance but expresses gratitude&nbsp;<br>
to the writer. Similarly, the sum, moon, stars, rains, cloud and other lifeless things are all&nbsp;<br>
subservient to God, the Almighty and All Powerful. He is the cause of everything. In fact, God is the&nbsp;<br>
writer and not<br>
200	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
the king in the above instance, God says : When you shot arrows, you did not shoot them but God shot.&nbsp;<br>
When it will be clear to you, the devil will be despaired of you and you will reach true stage of&nbsp;<br>
Tauhid.<br>
FREEDOM OF WILL: Now the question of freedom of will comes to you. You may question : How can you say&nbsp;<br>
that everything comes from God ? One man supplies you provision according to his wish. He may give it&nbsp;<br>
to you or may not give. He may kill you or not kill. How can you not fear him ? The answer is that the&nbsp;<br>
weak people commit these mistakes as do the ants. An ant sees the writing by the pen on the paper. It&nbsp;<br>
also sees that the front portion of the pen is making the pages black. The ant thinks that the pen is&nbsp;<br>
making the white paper black through mistake. It is the mistake of its sight. So is the mistake of one&nbsp;<br>
whose breast has not been expanded by the light of God. He does not see the ultimate Cause of all&nbsp;<br>
causes who is God. So he sees the writer as the agent of writing. This is extreme foolishness. Those&nbsp;<br>
who are experienced in spiritual things and whose inner light has been enkindled understand that God&nbsp;<br>
gave every ?tom of the heavens and earth power of speech with which they speak, and they have got such&nbsp;<br>
tongue by which they speak without voice. Those who are unable to hear it do not hear it. I don't mean&nbsp;<br>
the open ear with which voice is heard as voice is necessary for open hearing. By hearing I mean such&nbsp;<br>
thing which has got no letter or voice or language.<br>
Question : Your explanation is a wonder which can not be grasped by intellect. So please explain it&nbsp;<br>
clearly to us.<br>
Answer : Know, 0 readers, that those who have got spiritual illumination know that every atom within&nbsp;<br>
the heavens and earth has got its prayer which is endless andlimitless. It is such a word as comes from&nbsp;<br>
the ocean of the words of God. God says : Had the seas been ink for praise of my Lord, they would have&nbsp;<br>
dried up.' The secrets of the material and spiritual world talk secretly. To disclose those secrets is&nbsp;<br>
abominable, rather the breasts of the pious people are like graves of the secrets. Have you seen a&nbsp;<br>
trusted courtier of a king disclosing the secrets of the king? Had there been permission to disclose&nbsp;<br>
the secrets of everybody, the Prophet would not have said : Had you known what I know you would have&nbsp;<br>
laughed little and wept much. He also prohibited to disclose the secrets of Taqdir or fate. He said :&nbsp;<br>
When mention is<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	201<br>
made of stars, be silent. When mention is made of fate be silent. When mention is made of my&nbsp;<br>
companions, be silent. The Prophet sometimes disclosed some secrets to Huzaifah. This shows that the&nbsp;<br>
spiritually illumined persons do not disclose them for two reasons-impossibility of disclosing secrets&nbsp;<br>
and limitlessness of His praise.<br>
<br>
He who sees the writing on paper, sees the blackening of white paper by ink, (1) He asks the paper : I&nbsp;<br>
have seen your face white and bright but why do I find it now black? The paper says How is your&nbsp;<br>
judgment that you are asking me this question ? I have not made my face black but the ink pot was&nbsp;<br>
filled up with ink, the ink travelled to me and made my face black. He said : you have spoken the&nbsp;<br>
truth.<br>
<br>
(2) He asked the ink about it which said : You are unjust to me. I was living peacefully in inkpot but&nbsp;<br>
the pen forcefully took me out unjustly and separated me from my parent body. The pen is responsible&nbsp;<br>
for it and not myself. He said: You have spoken the truth.<br>
<br>
(3) He asked the pen : why have you taken out ink from the ink pot and thus have done injustice to it ?&nbsp;<br>
The pen said : Ask the hand and fingers about it. I was a reed by the river side. The hand cut the reed&nbsp;<br>
by a knife, cut me off from my parent body, severed my head and dived it into ink-pot Go from me and&nbsp;<br>
ask it which did injustice to me. He said : You have spoken the truth.<br>
<br>
(4) Then he asked the hand about its oppression on the pen and it said : I am nothing but a piece of&nbsp;<br>
flesh with blood. Have you sees a lump of flesh moving independently ? I am only a conveyance subject&nbsp;<br>
to order. Strength rides over me and orders me to do a thing. He said : You have spoken the truth.<br>
<br>
(5) He asked the strength : Why are you using the hand as servant and conveyance ? The strength said :&nbsp;<br>
Don't rebuke me. Do you think that I have oppressed the hand riding over it? I do not move it, nor do I&nbsp;<br>
order it. I sleep and remain quiet till a representative comes to me. He compels me to do a thing, The&nbsp;<br>
name of the representative is Will. He wakes me up from sleep and compels me to do an act. Then he said&nbsp;<br>
: You have spoken the truth.<br>
202	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
(6) He asked the will : What thing encourages you to move the strength and compels it to do the act ?&nbsp;<br>
The will said.: Don't punish me in haste as I have got an excuse. I do not rise myself, rather I am&nbsp;<br>
caused to rise by the order of intellect, the messenger of knowledge. He presents me in mind and order&nbsp;<br>
me : Awaken the strength. I am subject to intellect and knowledge. It is my bounden duty to obey it. I&nbsp;<br>
have got no way to go against it. So ask knowledge about it. He said: You have spoken the truth.<br>
<br>
(7) He asked knowledge about it. It said : I have been imprinted on the tablet of soul and I am the&nbsp;<br>
light of soul. I have got no light of my own and I have been lighted. I am only a tablet set firmly in&nbsp;<br>
soul. I have got no freedom. Ask the pen as without pen, nothing can be imprinted.<br>
<br>
At this time the questioner began to entertain doubt and the reply did not give him satisfaction. He&nbsp;<br>
said : I have passed many stages and everyone attributed responsibility on others and everyone gave&nbsp;<br>
satisfactory answer, but you say : The pen writes on me. The pen is a reed only, tablet is a plank only&nbsp;<br>
and light is but a (leak of fire. I heard in this stage light; writing, pen etc. But I don't see them.&nbsp;<br>
It is a wonder to me that I hear their sound, but do hot see them. Then knowledge said to him If what&nbsp;<br>
you say Is true, the reason Is that your provision is little and your conveyance is weak. Know that&nbsp;<br>
there are Injurious things in the path which you wish to tread. It is better to leave the way. What has&nbsp;<br>
been created for a man has been made easy fot him. Know that there are three hurdles in this&nbsp;<br>
path-material world, spiritual or unseen world and world of power and strength. Paper, ink, pen and&nbsp;<br>
hand appertain to this material world. The spiritual world will come after me. When you will go there&nbsp;<br>
In advance of me, you will reach that world. The third is a world of strength lying between this&nbsp;<br>
material and spiritual world. You have crossed three stages of this world-strength; will and knowledge.&nbsp;<br>
This world is intermediary or means between the material and the spiritual world. The material world is&nbsp;<br>
easier for the path and the spiritual would is more difficult. He who walks upon the ground walks upon&nbsp;<br>
the material world. He who takes a boat and embarks upon it, embarks upon the world of strength. He who&nbsp;<br>
walks upon water without the help of a boat or any conveyance walks in the spiritual world. If the&nbsp;<br>
belief of certainty enters your mind, you<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	203<br>
enter upon that stage as the Prophet said : Had his sure faith increased more, he would have sojourned&nbsp;<br>
in the air. Once a man asked Jesus Christ : Did Jesus Christ walk upon water ? the Prophet replied to&nbsp;<br>
the above effect.<br>
<br>
He (who treads the path of religion) asked again : I am tired of this affair, I fear the path you&nbsp;<br>
showed me. I know not whether I can cross it, Is there any sign of it ? Knowledge said : It has got its&nbsp;<br>
sign. Open your eye and confine your eye sight towards me. If at this, the matter of pen is made clear&nbsp;<br>
to you wherewith the tablet on the heart is written, you will be fit for the path. He who knocks at the&nbsp;<br>
door of the spiritual world after crossing the world of Zabarut or strength, will .find the affairs of&nbsp;<br>
the pen. Don't you see that the affairs of the pen were disclosed to the Prophet in his early stage ?&nbsp;<br>
God revealed for the first time : read and your Lord is the Almighty, who taught with the pen, who&nbsp;<br>
taught what man knew not---68: 1. .<br>
<br>
Then the trader of the path of religion asked : I have opened my eyes, but I don't find the reed or&nbsp;<br>
tablet or anybody. Then knowledge said : What do you say ? Did you not hear that the owner of the house&nbsp;<br>
is not like the owner of the furnitures of the house ? Don't you know that the being of God is not like&nbsp;<br>
the being of anybody ? Similarly His hand is not like the hand of anything of the material world. His&nbsp;<br>
pen is not like the pen of the material world. His word is not like the word of the material world and&nbsp;<br>
His writing is not like the writing of the material world. These are affairs of God appertaining to the&nbsp;<br>
spiritual world. The being of God has got no physique. He is not confined to any place as a thing of&nbsp;<br>
the world. His hand is not composed of blood, flesh and bone like that of man. His pen is not like the&nbsp;<br>
modest reed, his tablet is not made of plank, His pen has got no sound or letter, His writing has got&nbsp;<br>
no impression of ink. He who considers God like him, is dead. He who explains Him by example is a&nbsp;<br>
woman. You will be free from doubt if you have understood the following Hadis of the Prophet : God&nbsp;<br>
created Adam according to His image You will be free from doubt if you understand by this image secret&nbsp;<br>
attributes which can be seen with the eye of knowledge and not with the external eye. You stay then on&nbsp;<br>
the lofty hill. Why do you not travel in this way ? You will hear from the bottom of your heart what&nbsp;<br>
will be revealed to you and you will find guidance from the light. Perhaps you will be called from&nbsp;<br>
heaven as Moses was called : I am surely your Lord.<br>
204	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	205<br>
When the trader in the path of religion heard about this knowledge, he knew of his defects and was&nbsp;<br>
enraged at his passions and his mental fire broke out. Before this the light in his heart was dimly&nbsp;<br>
burning, even though it did not touch the fire. When knowledge was puffed up in his heart, his oil was&nbsp;<br>
enkindled. Then light upon light came to him. Then knowledge said to him: Value this moment greatly.&nbsp;<br>
Open your eyes, so that you may find the path. When he opened his eyes, he found the pen of God as&nbsp;<br>
described. It is not made of reed, it has got no head. It is incessantly writing in the mind or soul of&nbsp;<br>
men. He said being surprised at it: What a good thing is knowledge. I don't consider this pen as that&nbsp;<br>
of the material world.<br>
He then asked the pen: 0 pen, you are constantly writing knowledge of many things in the soul of men,&nbsp;<br>
the knowledge with the help of will is giving strength and the strength is helping an action. What is&nbsp;<br>
the mystery? The pen said: Have you forgotten that reply you have received from the pen of the material&nbsp;<br>
world? It placed responsibility on hand. He said: I have not forgotten it. The pen said: My answer is&nbsp;<br>
like that pen of the material world. Then he said: Have you heard that God created Adam of His own&nbsp;<br>
image? He said: I heard it. The pen then said: Then ask the angel of my right side about me. I am&nbsp;<br>
subject to him and he compels me to write. So there is no distinction between the pen of God and the&nbsp;<br>
pen of man regarding obedience, but there is difference in form. He asked: Who is the angel by the&nbsp;<br>
right side? The pen said: Have you not heard this verse - The heavens are in His right hand? He said:&nbsp;<br>
Yes, I heard it. The pen said: All the pens of the material world are within His right hand and the&nbsp;<br>
angels move them.<br>
<br>
Then he said that the right hand side is not like ours, their hands are not like ours, their fingers&nbsp;<br>
are not like lour fingers. When he asked the angel about pen, he said: The answer from the material pen&nbsp;<br>
is like it. It depends on strength. Then he went to the world of power and strength and saw such a&nbsp;<br>
wonderful thing which is very significant in comparison with that of this world. The strength said: I&nbsp;<br>
am an attribute only. Ask the owner of strength and power as it is the work of the owner of power and&nbsp;<br>
not of power. Then it was announced from behind the screen: He should not be asked what He does, but&nbsp;<br>
you will be asked what you do. He then lost his senses and when recovered exclaimed: All praise is due&nbsp;<br>
to Thee, I return to thee, I rely on Thee. Thou art<br>
All powerful. I fear nobody except Thee. 0 Lord, expand my breast, so that I may know Thee. Remove&nbsp;<br>
sluggishness from my tongue, so that I may praise Thee.<br>
<br>
Then there came the proclamation from behind the screen: Take care from the greed of praise don't go&nbsp;<br>
forward over the Prophet, rather return to him. Take what he gave you and forbid yourself from what he&nbsp;<br>
prohibited you - 59: 7. Say what he said to you as he said nothing about God except: Thou art pure, I&nbsp;<br>
can't recount Thy praise. Thou art, as thou hast praised Thee. Then he said: 0 God, if there is no&nbsp;<br>
power of tongue to praise Thee, should there be no greed of soul to know Thee? Then there came the&nbsp;<br>
proclamation: Be careful of treading the necks of the truthful. Return to the greatest truthful man and&nbsp;<br>
follow him and the companions of the Prophet who are like stars. You will find guidance from any of&nbsp;<br>
them. Have you not heard that He said: To be baffled in the search of My knowledge is the limit of&nbsp;<br>
knowledge. It is sufficient for you to be deprived of My knowledge of meeting with Me staying in front&nbsp;<br>
of Me. It is sufficient for you to be baffled in appreciating My grandeur.<br>
<br>
At this time, the sojourner in the path of religion returns and finds excuse to ask him. He says to the&nbsp;<br>
angel on the right and to the pen, knowledge, will and strength: Take my excuse. I have first entered&nbsp;<br>
this city. There is fear for every first entrant. Now it is clear to me that your excuse is true and&nbsp;<br>
the truth has come to me vividly that He who is the master of the material, spiritual world and the&nbsp;<br>
world of strength and power is the Almighty God. You are subservient to His will. He is the first and&nbsp;<br>
the last, the open and the secret.<br>
<br>
He is then asked: How is He the first and the last? These are contradictory terms. How is He the open&nbsp;<br>
and the secret? The first is not the last and the open is not the secret. He said: He is the First in&nbsp;<br>
comparison with the things created as all things come from Him in seriatim one after another. He is the&nbsp;<br>
Last in comparison with the things that will remain, as they will return from stage to stage till they&nbsp;<br>
return to God. That is the end of their journey. So He is the first of the past things and He is the&nbsp;<br>
last of the future things. He is secret to those who are in this material world and who search Him by&nbsp;<br>
their five external organs. He is the Open to those who search Him in the spiritual world in their<br>
206	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
lighted lamps of their hearts by the secret insight. This is true Tauhid and it is now clear to them&nbsp;<br>
that the cause of action is He.<br>
He who does not deny spiritual world should sojourn with those who walk in the path of religion. When&nbsp;<br>
faith becomes firm and sure, he enters the spiritual world. When purity of soul is increased, his sure&nbsp;<br>
faith also increases. If a man is seen in semi-darkness very early in the morning, you can understand&nbsp;<br>
that he is a man. Then when the sun rises, his faith remains the same but the figure of his body&nbsp;<br>
becomes vivid. The believers and the owners of Kashf are like the sorcery of the sorcerers of Pharaoh&nbsp;<br>
and the miracles of Moses. When Moses showed the miracle of a serpent the sorcerers of Pharaoh&nbsp;<br>
surrendered to Moses as they saw then the real truth and said to Pharaoh: Even if you cut off our hands&nbsp;<br>
and feet or crucify us, we shall not swerve an inch from the truth. Thus their hearts were expanded to&nbsp;<br>
such an extent that they preferred death than return to disbelief. In short the truth that is&nbsp;<br>
established after Kashf is not changed.<br>
Similarly there is no change of Tauhid near the owners of Kashf or inner introspection. But the Tauhid&nbsp;<br>
which is established upon general faith is like the sorcery of Pharaoh's sorcerers. Their look is only&nbsp;<br>
to the external serpent.<br>
Question: You say that the elements are also subservient. But how can man do a thing if he wishes and&nbsp;<br>
can not do if he does not wish.<br>
Answer: It is said that man writes by fingers, takes breath by nose and separates water from his body&nbsp;<br>
when he stands in water. Thus there are three different modes or work of a man writing, breathing and&nbsp;<br>
separation of water. These are different works but these are the same from the stand point of&nbsp;<br>
dependence. (1) The first kind of man's work is natural, for instance if he places his foot in water it&nbsp;<br>
becomes separate. (2) The second kind of man's work is natural wilful work, such as taking breath,&nbsp;<br>
passing stool and urine, taking food and drink. (3) The third kind of man's work is action of strength&nbsp;<br>
and power, such as walking talking etc. There is no power of man in the natural works. Whenever he&nbsp;<br>
stands in water or passes though the air, water or air goes away of itself. This is inevitable. The&nbsp;<br>
second kind of work is natural wilful work as man can not shut up his breath even after hard efforts.&nbsp;<br>
Therefore the will of taking breath comes automatically. Whenever a thing is heavy, it separates the&nbsp;<br>
lighter body and takes<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	207<br>
its own place. So heaviness and lightness are not subject to man's Will. Similarly the wilful acts of&nbsp;<br>
man are not subject to volition. Similarly the acts of volition are not subject to the will of man. If&nbsp;<br>
a man takes a needle and shows it in order to pierce the eye of another, the latter will suddenly close&nbsp;<br>
his eyes, even though it is his action of will. So actions of will also occur according to the natural&nbsp;<br>
dictation of God's laws. The third kind of work in connection with power has got some controversy.&nbsp;<br>
Writing, walking, talking etc. are acts requiring strength. It is said of these actions that a man do&nbsp;<br>
these things if he wills and does not do them if he does not will. From this, the people understand&nbsp;<br>
that these are actions of volition but these are also in fact not subject to his will. The reasons are&nbsp;<br>
given below.<br>
<br>
Will comes at the behest of intellect which says: This is an action profitable to you. All things are&nbsp;<br>
of two kinds - (1) One kind of things inform you openly or secretly that particular action is&nbsp;<br>
beneficial to you. (2) Another kind of things inform you after mature thoughts and efforts that a&nbsp;<br>
particular action is beneficial to you. The example of the first kind is that if anybody is about to&nbsp;<br>
throw needle in your eyes or to strike you with sword, you at once know that to remove it is beneficial&nbsp;<br>
to you. It is natural then that will rises with knowledge and power with will. You can then understand&nbsp;<br>
without any thinking that it will be beneficial to you to close your eyes. This knowledge raises will&nbsp;<br>
in your mind at once to close your eyes owing to will, and strength comes in your eyes to close them&nbsp;<br>
up. There are things however which require thinking and consideration whether it will be beneficial to&nbsp;<br>
you or not. If you think that it will be beneficial, then knowledge raises will which is the real will.&nbsp;<br>
Owing to will, there arises strength which produces an action and knowledge determines it. It&nbsp;<br>
determines which will be beneficial to you and which is right and which is wrong. So without the order&nbsp;<br>
of knowledge, will does not rise. That man is compelled to do an act means that the action comes from a&nbsp;<br>
foreign strength or power, and not from within himself. Action with power means that he is an object of&nbsp;<br>
will. It arises compulsorily at the order of knowledge or wisdom, as the action is good and beneficial.&nbsp;<br>
This order compulsorily arises in mind. Fire has got the strength of burning and fire compulsorily&nbsp;<br>
burns. So the action of fire is guided by an external agency, but God's action is the result of&nbsp;<br>
absolute will. Man's action lie between these two. It means that his action is not entirely guided<br>
208	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	209<br>
by others or absolute like the action of God. Man's will and strength are guided by another. A man is&nbsp;<br>
the object or intermediary of God's will and power flow. He gives birth to power and will within man.&nbsp;<br>
For' this reason, man is not completely guided by another like a tree. Hence the action of man cannot&nbsp;<br>
be called completely controlled This is what is called acquisition as man is the medium of the flow of&nbsp;<br>
God's power or intermediary path. This power flows through him according to the law of God. Hence man's&nbsp;<br>
action is not opposite to man's freedom or dependence. God's action is absolutely free and wilful with&nbsp;<br>
power. But His will and power are not subject to thinking and efforts like us.<br>
<br>
Question: You say that intellect raises will, will raises power and power raises motion. If it is true,&nbsp;<br>
each is begotten by another and not from the power of God. If you deny it, what is the meaning of one&nbsp;<br>
coming from another?<br>
<br>
Answer: It is not true that one comes from another. All these things depend on an original Power, the&nbsp;<br>
source of all powers. Only those who are perfect in knowledge can understand it. It is true that one&nbsp;<br>
thing is connected with another thing in a chain and that is with a condition. When there arises&nbsp;<br>
wisdom, then comes the will from the original power. Again intellect does not come unless there is life&nbsp;<br>
and life also does not come unless there is a body for life. It cannot be said that there is birth of&nbsp;<br>
life from body. The chain of arrangement of things is like that. God says: I have not created what is&nbsp;<br>
between heaven and earth out of sport. I have created both with truth. So what is between heaven and&nbsp;<br>
earth has been created according to a set purposes and arrangement and order. The nature of one created&nbsp;<br>
thing can not be changed to another. The arrangement with which a thing has been created cannot be&nbsp;<br>
altered. For instance, the'rise of some sort of knowledge is not delayed in foetus if there is life in&nbsp;<br>
it and wild is not delayed in case of rise of knowledge. This is well arranged plan.<br>
Question: Tauhid and Shariat - how do they get together? The meaning of Tauhid is that there is no doer&nbsp;<br>
of an action except God and the meaning of Shariat is to fix the duties of a servant..f the servant&nbsp;<br>
becomes the doer of an action, how can God becomE the doer?<br>
Answer: If an action has got two meanings, they are not conflicting. It is said that the ruler killed a&nbsp;<br>
certain man. In another meaning, it is said that the executioner killed the man. The meaning is the&nbsp;<br>
same as by order of the ruler, the executioner killed the man. In other words, the ruler killed the&nbsp;<br>
man. Similarly a man is said to do an action. In another meaning, it can be said that God does the&nbsp;<br>
action through the man. The meaning of His action is that He orders the action to be done and&nbsp;<br>
encourages it. The meaning that man does an action is that he is an object in whom He created&nbsp;<br>
knowledge, will and strength. So the movements of limbs are connected together with will and strength.<br>
<br>
The power of man is connected with the power of God, as the doer has connection with cause and the&nbsp;<br>
discoverer with discovery: Everything of man is linked with strength and connected with the object of&nbsp;<br>
strength or the flow of strength. This object of the flow of strength is called the master of action.&nbsp;<br>
In the Quran, all the actions are sometimes attributed by God to angels and sometimes to men and&nbsp;<br>
sometimes to Himself. About causing of death God says: The angels will cause their death. Again He&nbsp;<br>
says: &quot;God takes the life of a man at the time of his death.&quot; God says: Did you consider what crops you&nbsp;<br>
sow? God says: I sent down rain etc. God says: I sent to Mary My spirit or angel. He appeared to her in&nbsp;<br>
the form of a man - 19:17. God says: I infused My spirit in to him. God says: Fight against them. He&nbsp;<br>
will punish them through your hands. God says: You have not killed them but God killed them. God says:&nbsp;<br>
You have not shot arrows when you shot but God shot arrows. This means that your shooting is not like&nbsp;<br>
the shooting of God. You shot as a servant, but God shot as a master. God says: Have you considered&nbsp;<br>
about the life germ which you drop? Have you created it or Myself? The Prophet said describing the&nbsp;<br>
angel of uterus: He takes the life-germ in his hand, makes it a shape and says: 0 God, shall it be a&nbsp;<br>
woman or a man? God replies to what He wishes and the angel makes figure accordingly.<br>
<br>
The Prophet said: The angels of life and death once quarrelled. The angel of life said: I bring the&nbsp;<br>
dead to life. The angel of death said: I cause the living to die. God revealed to them? Stay upon what&nbsp;<br>
you been entrusted with. It is I who causes death and gives life. Nobody except I can make one dead or&nbsp;<br>
alive.<br>
210	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-N<br>
<br>
One repentant said: I am repentant of God `and not to Muhammad. The Prophet then said: This man&nbsp;<br>
recognised the right of one having right. He who attributes anything to God is really truthful. He&nbsp;<br>
recognises truth and its real nature. He who attributes everything to anything other than God is&nbsp;<br>
misguided. Nothing has got the, existence of its own. It depends on the existence of another. In that&nbsp;<br>
context the former thing is void. In fact, there is no truth except the Ever-living and Ever-existing.&nbsp;<br>
He exists by his own attribute. He is the truth and anything besides Him is void. The saint Sahal&nbsp;<br>
Tastari said: 0 writer, there was, God but you were not. He will exist and you will not exist you say&nbsp;<br>
now: I exist because I exist now. You did not exist before but now you say, I exist. So whose exists at&nbsp;<br>
present did not exist before.<br>
Question: Now it has been proved that everything is subject to order. So what is the meaning of reward&nbsp;<br>
and punishment, sin and virtue, pleasure of God and wrath of God?<br>
Answer: Know, 0 readers, we have described it in the chapter. of Gratefulness that good and evil occur&nbsp;<br>
at His. command. What has been ordered for a thing must occur. It has got no failure no disobedience.&nbsp;<br>
Everything was written. It awaits only for time, because everything written will occur in your case and&nbsp;<br>
must come to pass. What will not occur, it shall not come. What will occur in your- case has been made&nbsp;<br>
easy for you and what will not occur has been made difficult for you.<br>
STAGES OF GOD-RELIANCE: The stages of God-reliance are connected with kuowledge, condition and action.&nbsp;<br>
We have discussed about knowledge, condition is the intermediary between knowledge and action.&nbsp;<br>
Knowledge is the basis of condition and action is its fruit.<br>
MEANING OF GOD RELIANCE: The meaning of Tawakkal or reliance is to entrust an affair to another and to&nbsp;<br>
believe him fully in that respect. He who is entrusted upon is called wakil or pleader and he who&nbsp;<br>
entrusts in called Moakkil or client. So sure faith'in wakil is called reliance. I shall cite an&nbsp;<br>
example of an wakil in case of litigation. An wakil shall. have four qualities. - (1) sufficient power&nbsp;<br>
to understandr(2) ability, (3) power of speech, and (4) sympathy and kindness for client. With regard&nbsp;<br>
to the first quality, he must have power to understand the places of<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	211<br>
deception, false claim and even the minutest details. With regard to the second quality, nobody engages&nbsp;<br>
an wakil having no ability. He shall not flatter, shall not fear to disclose truth or feel shame or&nbsp;<br>
show cowardice. With regard to the third quality of power speech, he must have it, otherwise many good&nbsp;<br>
reasons can not be shown for want of clear expression. With regard to the fourth quality, he must try&nbsp;<br>
to help an oppressed client.<br>
<br>
Similar is God reliance. When reliance on an wakil with such descriptions is made, how much reliance on&nbsp;<br>
God should be made? When you believe that there is no master of an action, besides God, that he is All&nbsp;<br>
powerful and All knowing, that He bestows His kindness, favour, help on all the people<br>
'and some special peoples, that there is no power and might except through God, there is no knowledge&nbsp;<br>
but in Him, he must rely on him and will not look to his own power and strength as there is no power&nbsp;<br>
except in God. If you do not find in you this reliance, it is for two reasons-weakness in you in any&nbsp;<br>
one of the four qualities and weakness of faith in your mind. So without the united strength of mind&nbsp;<br>
and faith, God reliance does not become perfect. With these two things peace of mind can be attained.&nbsp;<br>
'Peace of mind is one thing 'and certainty of faith is another thing. There are many men with&nbsp;<br>
-certainty of faith who have got no peace of mind as Hazrat Ibrahim said: 0 my Lord, show me how you&nbsp;<br>
give life to a dead thing. God said: Have you got no faith? He said: Yes, I have, but in order to&nbsp;<br>
console my mind. Hazrat Ibrahim had full faith, but he was eager to see it to bring his peace of mind.&nbsp;<br>
There are many men having peace of man but with no sure faith. A Jew or a Christian may have peace of&nbsp;<br>
mind but no sure faith.<br>
<br>
Three classes of God-reliant man. There are three classes of God- reliant men according to the measure&nbsp;<br>
of their reliance on God. The first class of God reliant man is like one who entrusts all his affairs&nbsp;<br>
in a case to his wakil who is appointed by him from a consideration of his ability, eloquence and&nbsp;<br>
kindness. The second class of God-reliant man is more developed than the first. His condition is like&nbsp;<br>
that of an infant who knows nobody except his mother. When any danger comes, he takes refuge to his&nbsp;<br>
mother and believes nobody except his mother. In every condition, he catches hold of her cloth. When&nbsp;<br>
any danger comes to him in absence of his mother, the first word he utters -- 0 mother. Such a&nbsp;<br>
God-reliant man<br>
212	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	213<br>
relies on God as a child relies on his mother. The difference between the first and second classes is&nbsp;<br>
that in the latter one annihilates himself in God-reliance, while it is not so in the first case.<br>
The third class is the highest for a God-reliant man. Such a man lives before God is such a way as a&nbsp;<br>
dead man is kept before one who washes him. He thinks that he moves similarly at the hand of his&nbsp;<br>
original fate. He is firm and steady. He thinks that the flow, of his movements, strength, will,&nbsp;<br>
knowledge and other attributes run through Him compulsorily. He is not like a child who takes refuge to&nbsp;<br>
his mother, cries to her and runs after her mother. He is like that child who know that wherever he&nbsp;<br>
will stay, his mother will find him out. If he does not like to suckle his mother's breast, his mother&nbsp;<br>
will suckle him. Such a person gives up invocation as he trusts in His mercy and help and thinks that&nbsp;<br>
he will get more if he does not want than if he wants.<br>
Question: Is it possible?<br>
Answer: In answer to it, know, 0 readers, that it is not impossible, but it is difficult and rare. The&nbsp;<br>
second and third stages of God-reliance are more difficult than the first stage. The occurrence of the&nbsp;<br>
first stage of God-reliance is near possibility. Even if the second and third stages are attained, its&nbsp;<br>
lasting is still more difficult.<br>
We have mentioned that Tahid has got two outer covers and two inner substances. Similarly 'there is no&nbsp;<br>
deity but God' has got two outer covers and two inner substances. This appears from the following&nbsp;<br>
saying of the Prophet: Whose utters &quot;There is no deity but God&quot; confirning it in his heart with sincere&nbsp;<br>
faith. Paradise is sure for him. These two conditions exist secretly in the traditions which have got&nbsp;<br>
no such clear expressions, as sovereignty dots not come by utterance. The name of movement of the&nbsp;<br>
tongue is uttrence and the name of the tie of mind is also utterance which is the utterance of the mind&nbsp;<br>
behind which truthfulness and sincere faith lie. The throne of power is found for the near ones which&nbsp;<br>
are really selfless men. God says: 'They will be seated upon the thrones, reclining thereon and facing&nbsp;<br>
one another: The fortunate will have many fortunes. He described oily the fortunes of shade, fruits,&nbsp;<br>
trees, black-eyed virgins and such other pleasures pleasing -to the eyes, but these are also<br>
enjoyed by the lower animals. But the pleasure of reign and nearness to God is not to be compared with&nbsp;<br>
the above pleasures. Are these enjoyments more pleasant to the saints and sages than those to be had&nbsp;<br>
from the sight of Lord. He who is more addicted to satisfying his lust and carnal desire can be&nbsp;<br>
compared to a beast. God says regarding him: 'They are like beasts, nay they are more wretched: The&nbsp;<br>
cause is that the beasts can not search the nature of angels and they are confined within their nature.&nbsp;<br>
But man can attain the nature of angels. He who has got power to attain this, but does not do so is&nbsp;<br>
disliked. He who utters the Kalema only by mouth can not attain true God-reliance.<br>
<br>
Sayings of sages about condition of God reliance. It appears from the sayings of the sages that God&nbsp;<br>
reliance is confined within three stages. Abu Musa Daylmi said: I asked one day Abu Yezid: What is the&nbsp;<br>
meaning of God reliance? He said: What do you say about it? I heard my companions say: If the ferocious&nbsp;<br>
beasts and the poisonous snakes be by your left and right sides and if still your heart does not&nbsp;<br>
tremble, this condition is called reliance. Abu Yezid said: Yes, it is true that it is near&nbsp;<br>
God-reliance, but if the dwellers of heaven are marry making in paradise and the dwellers of Hell are&nbsp;<br>
suffering in Hell and if you are told to select either of these two and you select the former, it you&nbsp;<br>
will go out of God-reliance. What Abu Musa said is only an information regarding the stage of&nbsp;<br>
God-reliance and that is included in the third and highest class of God-reliance. Hazrat Abu Bakr,&nbsp;<br>
however, took precaution by covering the holes of serpents in the cave. It can't be said therefor that&nbsp;<br>
he gave up God-reliance. He did not do it to save his own life but the life of the Prophet Muhammad&nbsp;<br>
(P.H.) The man of God-reliance fears not the serpent but one who controls serpents as without God's&nbsp;<br>
help, the serpents have got no power to bite.<br>
<br>
Zun Nun Misri was once asked about God reliance. He said: To be separate from many deities and to cut&nbsp;<br>
off these causes is God- reliance. Abu Abdullah Qureshi was asked about God-reliance and he said: To be&nbsp;<br>
attached to God in every circumstance is God- reliance. He was again asked: Tell me more about it. He&nbsp;<br>
said: To give up the causes till one takes the Creator of cause as guide is God-reliance. Sayeed&nbsp;<br>
Kharraj said: God-reliance is the name of two things movement without peace and peace without movement.&nbsp;<br>
Peace without movement means<br>
214	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL.	Vol-IV<br>
peace of mind entrusting all affairs to God. Movement without peace means seeking such a refuge as a&nbsp;<br>
child seeks refuge to its mother and crises for help from her. Abu Ali said: There are three stages of&nbsp;<br>
God-reliance, first stage is reliance on God. The second stage is Taslim or self-surrender to God and&nbsp;<br>
the third stage is to entrust all affairs on God. God- reliant man feels peace in His promise,&nbsp;<br>
self-surrending man thinks divine knowledge as sufficient and one entrusting is satisfied with His&nbsp;<br>
orders.<br>
WORK OF GOD-RELIANT MAN. Know, 0 readers, that condition arises out of knowledge and the first of&nbsp;<br>
conditions is action. Some think that the meaning of God-reliance is to give up earnings, to give up&nbsp;<br>
efforts, and to lie -upon the ground like thrown plank or like meat on a wood. This is the conjecture&nbsp;<br>
of the fools, it is unlawful in Shariat which praises God-reliant men.<br>
MAN'S ACTION IS SUBJECT TO FOUR CONDITIONS(1) To know as profitable the earning of what is not in one's&nbsp;<br>
possession, (2) to hoard a profitable thing. (3) to remove an injurious thing which has not yet come&nbsp;<br>
such as to save oneself from thiefs, beasts and injurious things and (4) to adopt means to remove and&nbsp;<br>
impending danger like taking medicine to remove a disease. So the actins of man are not outside these&nbsp;<br>
four thingsearning a profitable thing to preserve it, to remove an injurious thing and to adopt means&nbsp;<br>
to remove a danger. From the above, three kinds of things arise-(1) what is absolutely necessary&nbsp;<br>
according to the laws of nature. (2) what is necessary but not absolutely necessary and (3) what can be&nbsp;<br>
done more in less time.<br>
(1) What is absolutely necessary-To give up what is absolutely necessary according to the natural laws&nbsp;<br>
of God is notGod- reliance, such as to give up food, water and air. When you are hungry and food is&nbsp;<br>
placed before you it is not God-reliance to give it up. This is against law of nature. Similarly if you&nbsp;<br>
do not cultivate land and hope for crops or if you do not cohabit with wife but still hope to have a.&nbsp;<br>
child, it will be madness and not God-reliance. It comes from knowledge and mental state. Knowledge&nbsp;<br>
consists in the fact that God gave you food, hand and teeth, and mental state consists in the fact that&nbsp;<br>
you must believe in the actions of God.<br>
(2) What is necessary but not absolutely necessary. For instance, one leaves a town and goes to deep&nbsp;<br>
jungle without a<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	215<br>
<br>
companion or without food and arms. Without these necessary things, there is chance of losing life.&nbsp;<br>
This action goes out of illegality on two conditions -(1) One condition is that he can go without&nbsp;<br>
necessary food if he has got the habit of remaining without food for several days.<br>
(2) The second condition is that one is habituated to live on eating grass, leaves and similar things.&nbsp;<br>
These acts are not Godreliance. The saint Ibrahim Khawas used to take with him in journey needle,&nbsp;<br>
scissor, rope and bucket and say: It does not harm God-reliance.<br>
It is reported that a man of world renunciation left villages and towns and wished to stay over&nbsp;<br>
hillocks and mountains for a week and said: I will not seek food from anybody until my Lord supplied&nbsp;<br>
it. When he stayed there for seven days, he was about to die for want of food, but still it did not&nbsp;<br>
come to him. Then he said: 0 my Lord, if you want me to live, send me such food as can keep me alive or&nbsp;<br>
else take my life to Thee. Then God revealed to the Prophet of that time: Tell him by My honour, I will&nbsp;<br>
not give you food till you return to inhabited places and keep company with men. Then he entered a town&nbsp;<br>
and kept company with men who took food for him and drink. He thus saved his life, but doubt arose in&nbsp;<br>
his mind. God sent him a voice from heaven: You have wished that you would change My law by your world&nbsp;<br>
renunciation you do not know that whatever I give to My servants as food, I consider it more proper to&nbsp;<br>
give it through the hands of My servants. If don't like to give it by the hand of My power. So to give&nbsp;<br>
up the means of sustenance is go against the natural law of God and hence it is contrary to the&nbsp;<br>
established laws of nature.<br>
I<br>
Question. What do you say about sitting idle without earning defending on God? Is it unlawful lawful or&nbsp;<br>
better? Answer. When it is not unlawful to stay in jungles without destroying oneself, why will it be&nbsp;<br>
unlawful to sit in towns without destroying one- self. Provision will come to him from such a source as&nbsp;<br>
is unthinkable. But if he shuts up his doors preventing therein of any man, it will be unlawful. If he&nbsp;<br>
is about to die, he must seek his food. The Prophet said: Had you relied on God with due reliance, He&nbsp;<br>
would have provided you with food, as He provides it to beasts and birds. They go out in the morning&nbsp;<br>
and return with full belly in the evening. Jesus Christ said: Look<br>
216	. TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	217<br>
at the bird. It does not sow crops, reap or store them. God provides them daily with food. If you say&nbsp;<br>
that your bellies are big, then look to the cows, buffaloes and elephants. Abu Eakub Susi said: The&nbsp;<br>
provisions of those who rely on God without efforts lie in the hands of men as those people remain busy&nbsp;<br>
to get provision. A certain sage said : All people live in the middle of the provisions of God, but&nbsp;<br>
some of them get them by begging some by efforts like merchants, some by industry and some by other&nbsp;<br>
means.<br>
(3) What can be done more within less time. This means to adopt measures to get this benefit. This goes&nbsp;<br>
out of God reliance as these people rely on causes of provision. The Prophet said those who rely on God&nbsp;<br>
do not care for charms and enchantments. He did not say that they do not earns do not live with the&nbsp;<br>
people and do not accept anything from anybody. Causes are two kindsone cause which takes out of God&nbsp;<br>
reliance and another cause which does not take out of it.<br>
In connection with these causes, there are three classes of God- reliant men. The first class included&nbsp;<br>
saints like Ibrahim Khawas and others. They wandered in jungles without taking provisions They remained&nbsp;<br>
relying on the mercy of God for a week or more without taking food. They used to take leaves of jungles&nbsp;<br>
and such other things available in jungles. If these things were not available, they kept themselves&nbsp;<br>
ready for death.<br>
The second class of God-reliant men sit in a town or village or in their houses or mosques. They are&nbsp;<br>
less than first class Godreliant men, still they rely on God. They receive food through the charity of&nbsp;<br>
people, but their minds are kept turned up towards God and not towards men. The third class of&nbsp;<br>
God-reliant men earn their livelihood in the name of God. Their minds do not turn away from God in&nbsp;<br>
earning money. This look is not towards the pen but to the master of pen who passes orders in writing.<br>
When Abu Bakr became Caliph, he still continued to go to markets with his bundle of cloth for sale. The&nbsp;<br>
Muslims asked him: Why do you do this ? You have been invested with the power of rule after&nbsp;<br>
Prophethood, He said : Don't prevent me from earning livelihood for the members of my family. If I&nbsp;<br>
destroy them I would be able to destroy others. At last the people fixed an allowance for maintenance&nbsp;<br>
of his family members. When he got the allowance he got opportunity for helping the general public<br>
of the Muslims. It is seen from this that he, being a God reliant men, did not give up earning his&nbsp;<br>
livelihood which was necessary. He did not however hoard. Abu Jafar Shaddad was the spiritual guide of&nbsp;<br>
Hazrat Junaid Bagdadi and was a God reliant man. He said : I kept my God reliance secret for the last&nbsp;<br>
20 years. I used to go to market daily and earn a dinar, but I did not go to bed leaving even a dinar,&nbsp;<br>
I used to take bath in the public bath room for a kirat and spent all the money before the advent of&nbsp;<br>
night. Hazrat Junaid did not talk of God-reliance before him. He used to say : I feel ashamed to speak&nbsp;<br>
of the stages of God reliance before him.<br>
Question. Which is better-to sit at home or to earn from outside?<br>
Answer. Know, 0 readers that it is better for one it keep seated at home, if he gives up earning in&nbsp;<br>
order to find time for good thought, Zikr and sincere divine service, and it is better to earn on the&nbsp;<br>
part of one who becomes impatient if he keeps seated at home and loves the company of man.<br>
Imam Ahmed once engaged a labourer poor man in a certain work. He ordered Abu Bakr Masuji to give the&nbsp;<br>
labourer his waves and an additional sum but the labourer did not accept the additional sum. When The&nbsp;<br>
labourer went away, Imam Ahmed said to him: Go to him and give him this sum as he will accept it now.&nbsp;<br>
Then he went to him, gave him the sum and he accepted it. On being asked the reason, Imam Ahmed said :&nbsp;<br>
He did not accept it first because he was greedy for it, When his greed when away he became dispaired&nbsp;<br>
and accepted it. When Ibrahim Khawas looked to any man at the time of accepting gift or feared his&nbsp;<br>
passion for that, he did not accept from him anything. He was asked : What wonder have you seen in you&nbsp;<br>
? He said : I saw Hazrat Khizr in my company but I left his company fearing that my mind might be&nbsp;<br>
addicted to him and as a result my God-reliance might go.<br>
Question. What is the sign of not relying on wealth?<br>
Answer. It is when wealth is lost by theft or where there is loss in business or when any danger&nbsp;<br>
befalls a man, he remains contended and his peace of mind is not disturbed and his mind does not feel&nbsp;<br>
aggrieved and his mind keeps calm as before. He who becomes impatient at the loss of property, becomes&nbsp;<br>
contended if the gets it. The sage Basher Hafi used to make<br>
218	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	219<br>
weaver's shuttles and then he gave it up. The reason is that the saint Boadi wrote to him a letter&nbsp;<br>
saying : I heard that you are taking the help of your livelihood by making weaver's shuttles. Have you&nbsp;<br>
considered that if God deprives you of the power of hearing and sight, with what thing will you earn&nbsp;<br>
your livelihood? When this fell in his mind, he gave up to make the implements of weaving. Some say&nbsp;<br>
that when he was expert in making spinning wheel, the people began to come to him and he gave it up.&nbsp;<br>
Some say that he gave it up after the death of his wife. The saint Sufiyan Saori had 40 dinars with&nbsp;<br>
which he carried on business. When his wife died, he giftedd them away.<br>
<br>
Question. Earning is impossible without money. How is it possible to be not addicted to money if one&nbsp;<br>
possesses it?<br>
<br>
Answer. Know it for certain that God supplies provisions to some persons even if they did not possess&nbsp;<br>
any property or money. Some people are ruined when their property is destroyed or taken away by theft.&nbsp;<br>
God does not do anything which has got no good in it. If he destroyed his property, it is for his good&nbsp;<br>
or for the good of his religion. God has bestowed favours on him by giving him wealth. When he dies of&nbsp;<br>
hunger, he should have this faith that it would be good for him in the Hereafter if he dies hungry. God&nbsp;<br>
has disliked it for him without cutting his virtues. When he believes it, it is equal for him to&nbsp;<br>
possess wealth or not to possess. Hazrat Omar said : I don't care whether I rise up in the morning poor&nbsp;<br>
or rich, as I don't know which is better for me. Whose has not perfected his sure faith in' three&nbsp;<br>
matters, God- reliance does not take firm root in him. For this Abu Solaiman Darani said to Ibn Abul&nbsp;<br>
Hawaii : I have got in<br>
every stage except sincere God-reliance and I take only the'smell of<br>
God-reliance. This was inspite of his high position. HeAid'T could not acquire reliance of the highest&nbsp;<br>
order God-reli*ice 4Oes not become perfect till one fully believes in three thit&gt;gs : Them is no doer&nbsp;<br>
except God, there is no giver of provisions &quot;t God and it it is better for one what God destined for&nbsp;<br>
him regarding his property, solvency birth and death. So the foundation of God-reliance is laid on the&nbsp;<br>
strength of faith. All the religious stages of words and deeds are established on the foundation of&nbsp;<br>
faith, In a word, the stage of Gdd-reliance is understandable, but they require heart and certain&nbsp;<br>
faith. The Sage Sahal Tastari said :,He who attributes faults to earnings, finds faults with sunnat and&nbsp;<br>
with the giving, up of earnings, finds fault with Tauhid.<br>
Question. What is the medicine which will turn the mind from attachment to the outer causes towards&nbsp;<br>
good conjecture of God?<br>
Answer. The medicine is to know that bad conjecture is the prompting of the devil and good thought&nbsp;<br>
comes from God. God says : The devil shows you fear of poverty and orders you to do evil acts, but God&nbsp;<br>
promises you from Him forgiveness and abundance-2 : 268. A certain sage said: He who lives with bad&nbsp;<br>
conjecture is greedy. When cowardice, weakness of mind and other outward causes unite in him, bad&nbsp;<br>
conjecture prevails over him and God-reliance completely takes leave of him. It is reported that a sage&nbsp;<br>
used to stay in the mosque and had no means of livelihood. The Imam of the mosque said to him one day :&nbsp;<br>
If you earn. It would be good for you. He did not give any reply to him. Thus the Imam told him thrice.&nbsp;<br>
At the fourth time, the sage said to him: A Jew living by the side of the mosque promised me two pieces&nbsp;<br>
of loaf daily. The Imam said : If his promise is true., your stay in the mosque is good for you. The&nbsp;<br>
sage said : 0 brother Imam had you not been Imam and not waited before God and the people with defect&nbsp;<br>
in Tauhid, it would have been better for you, as you have put greater preference to the promise of the&nbsp;<br>
Jew than the promise of God. The Imam of the mosque once asked a worshiper : Where do you get your food&nbsp;<br>
? He said : 0 Imam, turn a little, Let me revise my prayer which I prayed behind you. God is the&nbsp;<br>
trustee of the provision of all.<br>
(2) It is reported that Hazrat Ibrahim Adham had a servant named'Huzaifa Marashi. People asked him :&nbsp;<br>
What wonderful act of Ibrahim Adham have you seen? He said: We were in a journey to Mecca for several&nbsp;<br>
days during which we could procure no food. We then reached Kufa and took shelter to a big mosque&nbsp;<br>
there. Ibrahim looked at me and said : 0 Huzaifa,, you are striken with hunger. I confessed it. He said&nbsp;<br>
: Bring me an inkpot and paper. I brought them to him and he wrote. In the name of the Most Beneficent&nbsp;<br>
and Most Compassionate God. Thou art our object of love in every circumstance, and the goal of&nbsp;<br>
everybody is Thou. Then he wrote these verses : I praise Thee I am grateful to Thee, I remember Thee, I&nbsp;<br>
am hungry, I am thirsty, I am without cloth. I am guarantee for the above three out of six? 0 Lord,&nbsp;<br>
Thou art guarantee for the rest three. My praise for Three is like a flame of fire. Protect Thy servant&nbsp;<br>
from entry into the Fire.<br>
Then he handed over the paper to me and said : Go out with this paper, don't mind anything except God&nbsp;<br>
and hand over the<br>
220	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
paper to one with whom you meet first. Then I went out and handed over the paper to a man riding on an&nbsp;<br>
ass. He wept at this and said Where is the writer of the letter ? I said : He is in a certain mosque.&nbsp;<br>
He handed over me a purse of 600 dinars. Then I met a man to whom I asked about the rider of the ass.&nbsp;<br>
He said that he is a Christian. I came to Ibrahim and told him all the details to which he said : Don't&nbsp;<br>
touch it. He will come presently. After a while the Christian came to Ibrahim Kissed his head and&nbsp;<br>
embraced Islam.<br>
(3) Abu Eakub Basari said : I was without food at Mecca for ten days. Then I thought to go out and went&nbsp;<br>
by a hillock to find something to appease my hunger. I found a turnip thrown on the path way and took&nbsp;<br>
it- but a voice came from within myself: You are without food for the last ten days, but at last your&nbsp;<br>
fate has supplied you a rotten turnip. I threw it away and returned to the mosque when an unknown&nbsp;<br>
person advanced to me and took his seat and handed over to me a box containing biscuits sugar and&nbsp;<br>
kernel of almond and said : This is for you. I said : Why have you selected me for this ? He said :&nbsp;<br>
Know that I was in sea for ten days in a journey. When my boat was about to sink, I took an oath that I&nbsp;<br>
would present this thing to a servant whom I will meet first if God saves me from this trouble. You are&nbsp;<br>
the first man who came to my notice. I said : Open it and accept it. Then he opened it and it contained&nbsp;<br>
biscuits, kernel, almond and refined sugar. I took one handful from this and a handful from that and&nbsp;<br>
said to him : The rest is my present to your companions. I accepted it. Then I said to myself :&nbsp;<br>
Provision has come to you easily, but you were searching it for the last ten days near the village.<br>
(4) The saint Momshed Dinawari said: I had debts for which I became troubled in mind. One day I saw in&nbsp;<br>
a dream that one man said to me: 0 miser, you have given Me such amount of debt your duty is to accept&nbsp;<br>
and My duty is to give. Thereafter I did not take accounts from the seller of vegetables or meat or&nbsp;<br>
anybody else.<br>
<br>
(5) The sage Bunan Hammad said: I started towards Mecca from Egypt. I had sufficient provisions with&nbsp;<br>
me. A woman came to me and said: 0 Bunan, you are a labourer. You bear burdens on your shoulder and&nbsp;<br>
think that God will Plot give you provision. He said: Then I threw away my provisions. Three days&nbsp;<br>
passed away consequitively over me without any food. Then I found a silver ornament on the way and said&nbsp;<br>
to myself: I shall bear it till its<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES . 221<br>
owner comes perh4ps he may give me something of it after I return it to him. Suddenly the woman came to&nbsp;<br>
me and: You are a tradesman, you say that you would take something of it, if its owner comes. Then she&nbsp;<br>
gave me some dirhams and said: Spend it. I took them and came to Mecca.<br>
(6) A slave was required for the sage Bunani. He told his brothers clearly about it. They collected the&nbsp;<br>
price of the slave. They said: The caravan of slave women is coming and you will purchase according to&nbsp;<br>
your choice. When the caravan arrived, they all selected a slave woman and said: This slave woman would&nbsp;<br>
be better for him. They told her master: What is her price? He said: This slave woman is not for sale.&nbsp;<br>
When they pressed him for sale he said: This slave woman is for Bunan Hammad. I took her for him from&nbsp;<br>
Samarkand to present her to him. I took her to Bunan and told him all the details.<br>
(7) It has been reported that in ancient times a man was in journey with a loaf. He said: If I eat it,&nbsp;<br>
I will die. God entrusted an angel to him and said: If he eats it, give him more provision and don't&nbsp;<br>
give him any other thing. He carried the loaf but did not eat it till this death. It lay before him at&nbsp;<br>
the time of his death.<br>
(8) Abu Sayeed Kharraj said: I entered a jungle without taking food and became hungry. I saw a village&nbsp;<br>
from a distance and started towards it being pleased. Then I thought within myself: Have I relied on&nbsp;<br>
others? So I took oath not to enter the village. I will go there if I am taken there by anybody. I dug&nbsp;<br>
a heapful of sands and covered my body upto my breast. At mid night I heard a voice saying: 0&nbsp;<br>
inhabitants of the village, go to such a person. Then a group of men came and took me out and carried&nbsp;<br>
me to the village.<br>
(9) It has been reported that a man kept himself seated before the door of Omar. An unseen voice said :&nbsp;<br>
0 man, have you taken refuge to Omar and not to God ? Go and turn the Quran, as it will make you free&nbsp;<br>
from want from the door of Omar. Then the man disappeared from that place. Hazrat Omar also lost him.&nbsp;<br>
He took to silence and engaged himself in divine worship. One day Hazrat Omar came to him and said : I&nbsp;<br>
was eager for you. Why did you come from my place ? He said: I recite the Quran and that has made me&nbsp;<br>
free from seeking assistance from Omar and his family. Hazrat Omar said : May God shower blessings on&nbsp;<br>
you. What<br>
222	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	223<br>
have you found in the Quran ? He said : I saw therein : There is in the sky your provision and what has&nbsp;<br>
been promised to you. Hazrat Omar said : My provision is in the sky and I am seeking it in the earth.&nbsp;<br>
Saying this, he began to weep and said : You have spoken the truth. Afterwards Hazrat Omar used to come&nbsp;<br>
to him and sit with him.<br>
Abu Hamzah Khorasani said: I started for pilgrimage in a year. While I was travelling I fell down in a&nbsp;<br>
well. My mind sought help of others. I said : By God. I will not do it. When this was crossing m mind,&nbsp;<br>
I found two men passing by the well. One man said to another : Come and let us shut up the cover of&nbsp;<br>
this well, so that no man may fall into it. So they took bamboos and chatai and closed its mouth. I&nbsp;<br>
then wished to raise a cry. Sometimes after, an animal came and removed the cover from the mouth of the&nbsp;<br>
well and extended its foot into the well. I caught it and it took me out of the well. I found that it&nbsp;<br>
is a ferocious animal. Then it went away. Then there came a voice from heaven : 0 Abu Hamzah, is it not&nbsp;<br>
better that I have saved you through a beast of destruction ? I then began to walk singing<br>
Shame of Thee prevents me from expressing love,<br>
What I got from thee satisfied my thirst,<br>
&quot;I find Thy kindness expressed in all my actions.<br>
Thou hast shown me kindness in matters, open and secret. Thou gave me news of secret thing to get Thy&nbsp;<br>
love. Being fearful of Thee and trembling. I took to solitude. That fear brought me near Thee, endeared&nbsp;<br>
Me to Thee. Thou hast kept me alive engrossed in Thy love.. These are some few instances of&nbsp;<br>
God-reliance.<br>
GOD-RELIANCE OF A MAN HAVING FAMILY. Know. 0 readers, that he who has got family has got permission to&nbsp;<br>
give up loneliness, as his God-reliance does not become perfect without two things-(1) power to keep&nbsp;<br>
patience without showing any anxiety in case of hunger for a week and (2) power to remain satisfied&nbsp;<br>
over destiny and God's provision. He will be able to bear the pangs of hunger till death even if his&nbsp;<br>
provision does not come because he knows that even though death and hunger are injurious in the world,&nbsp;<br>
they are better in the next world. He thinks that he is being led to the provision of the next world&nbsp;<br>
and that he is given such a disease for the sake of which his death will come and he will remain&nbsp;<br>
satisfied with it. He thinks also that<br>
whatever provisions is destined for him in the world, he will get. His God-reliance becomes perfect&nbsp;<br>
with this thought. But he is not allowed to give trouble to his family members by his hunger, as he is&nbsp;<br>
allowed to teach them the rewards of suffering the pangs of hunger.<br>
It is reported that Abu Torab Nokshibi said to a man who was about to eat the outer cover of water&nbsp;<br>
melon after remaining hungry for three days : Your Sufism has not come out to be true. So stick to&nbsp;<br>
market. In other words, Sufism cannot be acquired without God-reliance and it cannot be purified unless&nbsp;<br>
one has got patience of forbearing the pangs of hunger for more than three days. The saint Abu Ali&nbsp;<br>
Rozbari said : When a poor man says after five days hunger, l am hungry tell him to earn it in markets.&nbsp;<br>
He who is baffled in earning even after efforts is not deprived of his earning. Don't you look to the&nbsp;<br>
foetus in mother's womb that though it moves its naval chord keeps attached to its mother, so that it&nbsp;<br>
may take its food ? It is not made possible by the skill of the foetus. When it becomes separate, He&nbsp;<br>
makes its mother overflowed with affection for the child, so that she may maintain it. Then till the&nbsp;<br>
teeth of the child appears, He supplies its food from the breast of its mother. That does not require&nbsp;<br>
chewing, but the child suckles its mother's breast. Is it for the skill of the mother or of God ? When&nbsp;<br>
he becomes fit for chewing food teeth appear with which it chews food just like a mill. When he comes&nbsp;<br>
of age the causes of travelling in the next worldbecome easy for him. God gave in the minds of the&nbsp;<br>
Muslims kindness for the poor. Before this, only mother showed affection to the child but now there are&nbsp;<br>
hundreds to show him kindness. Before that they did not look at him as they found their parents&nbsp;<br>
maintaining him, When they find him bereft of parents, God enkindles in them the sense of charity.&nbsp;<br>
Nowhere was it seen that an orphan boy died of starvation although he had none to look after. God&nbsp;<br>
maintains him through the kind people and He also creates kindness in them.<br>
A Poet says:<br>
The pen of destiny runs always, Movement and stay all equal,<br>
Think of sustenance without our knowledge. Who does supply foetus with food?<br>
224	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Your duty is to remain satisfied with little provision and food<br>
which are necessary for you, because it will come to you though you flee away from it. now it is the&nbsp;<br>
duty of God to send you provision through the intermediary of men which you have not conceived. God&nbsp;<br>
says : God finds out a way for one who fears God and supplies your provision from a source which you&nbsp;<br>
cannot conceive 65: 2. But he never guaranteed you to supply fowl or other tasteful dishes. He&nbsp;<br>
guarantees such food as is barely necessary for you in your life. God says : There is provision for you&nbsp;<br>
in heaven and what has been promised to you. The secrets of heaven can not be enquired into. For this&nbsp;<br>
reason, when a group of man approached Junaid Bagdadi, he said to them : What do you search ? They said&nbsp;<br>
: We search provision. He said : If you know that He forgot you, you can remind Him of it. They said :&nbsp;<br>
We shall sit tight at home depending on God and see what happens. He said : If you rely on God in order&nbsp;<br>
to examine Him. you will be entertaining doubt. They asked : Then what is the remedy ? He said : Give&nbsp;<br>
it up. The saint Ahmed bin-Isa said : I was hungry while I was in the vast area of a jungle. I became&nbsp;<br>
so much weak that even I could not pray to God for food. I said to myself : This is not the action of&nbsp;<br>
the God-reliant man. My spirit told me to pray to God for patience. As I was about to pray, I heard a&nbsp;<br>
voice from heaven:<br>
&quot;He thinks he came very close to Me,<br>
I never do harm who comes close to Me, With efforts at places he prays to Me,<br>
He thinks I see him not, nor does he see Me.&quot;<br>
<br>
I understand from this that he whose passion is weak but heart strong remains always satisfied and has&nbsp;<br>
got faith in God even though he is about to die. Death is inevitable. It comes also to him whose mind&nbsp;<br>
is not satisfiednln a word, contentment on the one hand a fld obedience to the Grantor on the other&nbsp;<br>
bring God reliance. Trust him who stood surety for those who remain satisfied through the current&nbsp;<br>
causes and examine to see the truth of His promise. You will find then what a wonderful provision comes&nbsp;<br>
to you which is not even within your conception. Don't wait for causes in your God reliance, rather&nbsp;<br>
wait for the Controller of causes as you don't look to the pen for writing but to the mind of the&nbsp;<br>
writer as it is the mind which moves the pen. The first cause is One. Look to Him and not to the&nbsp;<br>
intermediary<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	225<br>
causes. This is the condition of God reliance for one who takes journey in jungle land without&nbsp;<br>
provisions or in towns and villages unrecognisid. He who engages himself in divine worship and pursuit&nbsp;<br>
of knowledge is a true religious man inspite of the kind of food he eats and the kind of cloth he&nbsp;<br>
wears. These kinds of things come to him unasked for.<br>
To think for provision is weakness and a cause of harm. Some Persian Emperor asked a wise sage : Why do&nbsp;<br>
the fools become wealthy and the intelligent poor?<br>
He said: The great God wished that the people should recognise Him. If he had supplied provision to&nbsp;<br>
every learned man and deprived every fool from it, they would have thought that only wisdom has&nbsp;<br>
supplied him provision. When they find it to the contrary they come to know that there is a great Giver&nbsp;<br>
of provision which has got no connection with the external causes. The poet sings :<br>
If provision flowed over the hillock of Haza,<br>
Birds and beasts would have perished not knowing it.<br>
CONDITION OF THE GOD-RELAYING MAN ABOUT CAUSPS: The people in relation to God are lire a company of&nbsp;<br>
beggars whq. wait in the courtyard of an Emperor for food, Before them, the numerous servants of the&nbsp;<br>
emperor came out. The emperor ordered them to give some beggars one loaf, some two loafs and not to&nbsp;<br>
deprive anybody. He ordered a proclaimer who proclaimed in the'name of the emperor&quot;Keep silent and when&nbsp;<br>
my servants go out to you don't come to them, rather sit in one place in peace, and the servants will&nbsp;<br>
take food to you as ordered. Whose comes to the servants and takes two loafs giving them trouble, one&nbsp;<br>
servant will follow him after the opening of the courtyard and he will be entrusted to him and&nbsp;<br>
punishment will be meted out to him up a to a certain time but I will keep it secret. He who does not&nbsp;<br>
give trouble to the servants but remains satisfied with only one loaf coming from the servants and&nbsp;<br>
remains quiet, I will give him such reward on a day on which others will be punished. He who remains in&nbsp;<br>
his place and takes two loafs as ordered shall get no punishment or-reward. If my servants does not&nbsp;<br>
find any one, they will not give him anything and he will remain hungry for the night, not being&nbsp;<br>
displeased with the servants nor informing them<br>
226	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
of the King's order. I will appoint such a man as my minister and I will transfer my power to him.<br>
After this proclamation, the beggars were divided into four classes. Belly prevailed over one section&nbsp;<br>
and they did not care for the promised punishment. They said : We are now hungry and there is a great&nbsp;<br>
distance between today and tomorrow. They went hurriedly to the servants, inflicted on them trouble and&nbsp;<br>
snatched from them each two loafs. Punishments were given to them within the promised time. They&nbsp;<br>
afterwards repented but to no effect.<br>
(2) The second class of beggars gave up the company of the servants being fearful of punishment, but&nbsp;<br>
each took two loafs beings pressed by hunger. They escaped punishment but did not get rewards.<br>
(3) The third class of beggars said : We shall sit before the servants, so that they may not for get&nbsp;<br>
us. When they will give us, we shall accept and remain satisfied, so that we may get rewards.<br>
(4) The fourth class of beggalls kept themselves concealed in a corner of the courtyard and went out of&nbsp;<br>
the sight of the servants. They said : If they enquire of us and give us, we shall remain satisfied&nbsp;<br>
with one loaf only. If they forget us, we shall bear the pangs of hunger at night. We may then get the&nbsp;<br>
posts of ministers and keep near the empergr.<br>
The servants went to the beggars from every, corner and gave everybody one loaf. Then it continued for&nbsp;<br>
days together. After some days, those beggars who kept themselves concealed in a corner of the&nbsp;<br>
courtyard and who did not fall to the notice of the servants passed a long time hungry. Two of them&nbsp;<br>
said Had the servants seen us, we would have- loafs and thus our hunger would have been appeased. The&nbsp;<br>
third beggar kept silent up to the next morning and got the post of minister. Thus is the simile of all&nbsp;<br>
men.<br>
The meaning of the courtyard is this world's life, the meaning of the door of the courtyard is death,&nbsp;<br>
the meaning of the indefinite promised subject is the day of recurrection, the meaning of the promised&nbsp;<br>
post of a minister is the provision of martyrdom for God-reliance on account of hunger. It will&nbsp;<br>
continue upto the day of resurrection, as the martyrs are alive<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	227<br>
before their Lord and are provided with provisions. He who keeps company with the servants depends on&nbsp;<br>
cause or intermediary. The servants stand for the causes or the means. Those who keep seated before the&nbsp;<br>
servants in the open courtyard are those who keep themselves in mosques and monasteries in towns and&nbsp;<br>
villages. Those who keep themselves concealed in a corner are thosl' who travel in jungles relying on&nbsp;<br>
God. Causes follow them and provisions come to them without search. Men are divided into these four&nbsp;<br>
classes. Ninty per cent adopt the means and causes. Out of the remaining ten, nearly seven persons live&nbsp;<br>
in towns and are well-known. The remaining three sojourn in jungles, Out of these three, two are&nbsp;<br>
displeased with causes and only one reaches the limit of nearness. This was the case in the earliest&nbsp;<br>
period of Islam, but at present there is not a single man out of every ten thousand persons, who can&nbsp;<br>
give up the means and causes.<br>
<br>
(2) The second mode of putting God-reliance in to practice is saving. There are three conditions of a&nbsp;<br>
man who get wealth either by inheritance or by earning or by any other means. The first condition is to&nbsp;<br>
adopt everything up to the measure of necessity, to eat when hungry to put on cloth to cover nakedness&nbsp;<br>
and to take a house only for habitation in absence of any house. Such a person keeps away from other&nbsp;<br>
properties and materials. He takes only what is necessary, but does not hoard. This is the highest&nbsp;<br>
stage of God-reliance. The second condition is opposite to the first stage. He gives up God-reliance if&nbsp;<br>
he stores up provision for more than one year. A certain sage said that there are three kinds of&nbsp;<br>
animals who store up provision-rats ants and men.<br>
<br>
The third stage of God-reliance is of a person who hoards up provisions for 40 days or less tban'40&nbsp;<br>
days. Sahal Tastari ousted him from the limit of God-reliance. Ibrahim Khawas also entertained the same&nbsp;<br>
opinion. Abu Taleb Makki retained him within the limit. Every good thing has got its beginning and end.&nbsp;<br>
Those who reach the end are called &quot;Sabegin&quot; or those going in advance. Those who remain in the initial&nbsp;<br>
stage are called the companions of fortune (Ashabul Yemin). There are different stages of these&nbsp;<br>
companions and also of Sabeqin. The fortunate persons of first stage are attached to the persons of the&nbsp;<br>
lowest stage going in advance. So under the circumstances there is no meaning in fixing time and&nbsp;<br>
measures of saving. The real thing is<br>
228	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	229<br>
that God-reliance does not become perfect without curtailing hopes in case saving is given up. The&nbsp;<br>
lowest stage of hope is one day and one night or even lower than that and the highest stage of hope is&nbsp;<br>
the life span of a man. There is a great deal of difference in it. Hazrat Moses fasted consequitively&nbsp;<br>
for 40 days in order to attain spin itual height. Without that, he could not leave reached it according&nbsp;<br>
to the laws of God, as the Prophet said : God prepared the earth to create Adam for 40 days, as the&nbsp;<br>
earth required these days to be fit for making Adam, In short he who hoards up for more then 40 days&nbsp;<br>
goes out of God reliance for his weak mind and for his attachment to external causes. God is the&nbsp;<br>
ultimate cause of provision and food-stuffs are only a means to it. If reliance is placed upon&nbsp;<br>
provisions of a year, how can there be God reliance ? He who hoards for two months only is certainly&nbsp;<br>
higher than he who hoards for a year. He who -does not hoard at all is the best.<br>
There is a welt known story that the Prophet once ordered Hazrat Ali and Hazrat Osman to wash the dead&nbsp;<br>
body of a poor man. They washed and buried him. Thereafter the Prophet said to his companions : He will&nbsp;<br>
be raised up on the Resurrection Day in such a condition that his face will be brilliant like the moon&nbsp;<br>
in full moon light-night. Had not there been in him a habit, his face would have been radiant like the&nbsp;<br>
sun. We asked : 0 Prophet of God what is it? he said : He fasted, prayed prayers and remembered God&nbsp;<br>
much. When the winter came, he used to store up cloths for the following summer and when the summer e,&nbsp;<br>
he used to store winter cloth for the following winter. Th the Prophet said : I am seeing little of&nbsp;<br>
sure faith and determined patience in what has been given to you. The business man has not been told to&nbsp;<br>
give up business and the industrialist to give up industry but they were not enjoined to keep&nbsp;<br>
themselves very busy in those things. Rather he called all persons towards God and showed them such a&nbsp;<br>
path which will help them towards success and salvation and turn their mind from the world. The best&nbsp;<br>
thing with which one can engage himself is mind. So it is necessary for a man of weak faith to store up&nbsp;<br>
what is necessary as it is proper for a man of sure faith not to store anything. This is necessary for&nbsp;<br>
a man without family.<br>
<br>
God-reliance of a man having family. A man having family will not go out of the limit of God-reliance&nbsp;<br>
if he stores up<br>
provisions for one year, as by this his weak faith and his mind can be kept quiet. But if he goes&nbsp;<br>
beyond that limit, his God-reliance will be destroyed. The meaning of God-reliance is firm faith in&nbsp;<br>
Tauhid, quiet mind in God's mercy and sure faith in the well-controlled laws of God. The Prophet used&nbsp;<br>
to store up provisions for his family for one year. He again prohibited Omme Ayman and others for&nbsp;<br>
storing even for tomorrow. Hazrat Bilal stored up one piece of bread for his breaking fast. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
prohibited him from doing it and said : 0 Bilal, Spend and fear no poverty from God. The Prophet said :&nbsp;<br>
When you are asked for, don't prohibit. When you are given, don't conceal it. Follow the right men of&nbsp;<br>
God reliance. The Prophet had such small hope of life that after passing calls of nature he took the&nbsp;<br>
method of Tayammam even though water was close by and said Who will give me guarantee that I will be&nbsp;<br>
able to get time to reach that water ? When the Prophet stored up, his God-reliance was not reduced a&nbsp;<br>
little as he did not depend on the stored up thing. The reason that the Prophet stored up for one year&nbsp;<br>
for his family members, rather it was a way of life shown for his followers of weak faith. So it&nbsp;<br>
appears that hoarding is beneficial to some but harmful to others. It is clear from the following Hadis&nbsp;<br>
of Abu Omamah Baheli. On of the inmates of Suffah died but his coffin cloth was not found. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said : Examine his cloth. On search, two dinars were found in his cloth. The Prophet said : He will&nbsp;<br>
have two spots. He did not tell it in case of a rich Muslim.<br>
<br>
Hussain Magzali one of the disciples of Bashar Hafi said : I was one noon near Basher Hafi. An old&nbsp;<br>
emaciated man came to him and Basher Hafi stood up in his honour. I did not see him standing for any&nbsp;<br>
other person than him.' Then Basher Hafi handed over me one handful of silver coins and said : Bring&nbsp;<br>
for us delicious foods as fast as possible. He did not tell us this thing before. I brought delicious&nbsp;<br>
foods and placed them and he ate with him. I did not see him taking food with others before this. We&nbsp;<br>
ate to our satisfaction and yet there remained surplus food. The man took the surplus food in his cloth&nbsp;<br>
and went away. I wondered at it as it did not appear to me decent. Basher Hafi told me : Perhaps it did&nbsp;<br>
not appear to you to be good. I said : It is true. Why is it that he took the surplus foods without&nbsp;<br>
your permission? Basher Hafi said : He is our friend named Fathe Musalli. He came from Masud to day and&nbsp;<br>
met us. He wanted to teach us that when God-reliance becomes perfect, there is no harm in hoarding.<br>
230	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
The third mode of putting God-reliance into practice is to<br>
adopt means to remove an impending danger. God-reliance is<br>
not impaired by that. It is prohibited to sleep in places infected by<br>
ferocious beasts or near a hillock, or near a torrent, or a wall<br>
inclined to fall. The causes are three-(1) what is absolutely necessary, (2) what is begotten by guess&nbsp;<br>
and (3) what arises from idea. It is one of the conditions of God-reliance to give up causes arising&nbsp;<br>
out of ideas. To remove injuries by adopting spells and charms is included within ideas. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said that one cannot be Go-reliant if he does not give up charms. Spells and enchantments. He did not&nbsp;<br>
prohibit to use warm clothes in cold countries. God says : Take Him as wakil and keep patience at what&nbsp;<br>
they say. God says : They said : We shall keep patience at your oppression on us. God-reliant persons&nbsp;<br>
depend upon God-14:16. God says : So forget their oppression and depend on God-33: 48. God says : Have&nbsp;<br>
patience as the Prophets with firm determination kept patience. God says : Those doers are good who&nbsp;<br>
kept patience and those who rely on their Lord. These verses were revealed in connection with the&nbsp;<br>
oppression of men. It is not God- reliance not to try to prevent the injuries of serpents, ferocious&nbsp;<br>
beasts and such other beings except men. Similarly God- reliance is not impaired if means are adopted&nbsp;<br>
to remove injuries to properties. The Prophet said to a desert Arab : Why have you let loose your&nbsp;<br>
camel? He said : I let it loose depending on God. He said : Tie it and depend on God. God says : Take&nbsp;<br>
recourse to your care. He said describing the prayer of fear : Let them take their arms. God says.&nbsp;<br>
Prepare for them instruments of strength and the tie of horses as far as possible-8 : 60. God said to&nbsp;<br>
Moses : Travel at night with My servants. This means that he should go out at night to escape search of&nbsp;<br>
his foes. The object of the Prophet's hiding in a cave when leaving Mecca is to ward off injuries from&nbsp;<br>
the enemies.<br>
Question. There are stories of a group of saints that they climbed upon tigers which submitted&nbsp;<br>
themselves to them. In answer to that it may be said that that stage of God reliance should not deceive&nbsp;<br>
you. If the stories are correct, it should not be followed as they were then in the highest stage and&nbsp;<br>
these are included within miracles. There is no such condition of God- reliance.<br>
<br>
Question. Is there any sign of that stage ? In answer to that I might say that the person who reaches&nbsp;<br>
that stage does not require<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	231<br>
<br>
such signs but one of the signs is that your companion, dog of anger, will remain subdued to you. If it&nbsp;<br>
submits to you, it shall not bite without your signal. Your condition sometimes will reach such a high&nbsp;<br>
stage that even tiger, the king of beasts, will be subdued to you. When your own dog will be subdued to&nbsp;<br>
you, don't be anxious to subdue the other dogs.<br>
<br>
Question. When a God-reliant man keeps arms as a means of protection from the enemies and keeps the&nbsp;<br>
doors closed as protection from thiefs how can he be God-reliant?<br>
Answer. He will be God-reliant on account of knowledge and mental condition. Regarding knowledge, he&nbsp;<br>
should know that even if the doors are closed the thief can not be prevented from his acts of theft. If&nbsp;<br>
God does not drive him out, he can't be driven out. How many doors are closed for fear of thieves, but&nbsp;<br>
that also does not do any benefit. How many armed men are murdered inspite of their arms. So don't&nbsp;<br>
basically rely on these causes but rely on the Master of causes. With regard to the mental condition,&nbsp;<br>
it must be believed that what has been lotted cannot be blotted. On this thought, he remains satisfied&nbsp;<br>
and says: 0 God, if you have engaged anyone to take my properties, I shall remain satisfied and that&nbsp;<br>
property goes in your path. I don't know whether this is my provision or the provision of another&nbsp;<br>
according to destiny. I am satisfy with what you do. It is also your order that I have closed the door&nbsp;<br>
or kept it under lock and key. 0 Creator of causes, I rely on nobody except on Thee.<br>
<br>
When there is such state of his mind and his knowledge as above described, his arming and closing of&nbsp;<br>
doors will not take him out of the limit of God-reliance.<br>
Question. Is there any property of a God-reliant man that can be stolen? Answer. Yes, such as utensils&nbsp;<br>
for food, cups for drink, jar for ablution, vessel for keeping food stuffs, stick for driving out&nbsp;<br>
enemies and such other necessary things.<br>
Some rules of God reliant man regarding property. He is to observe some rules in protecting his&nbsp;<br>
property if he goes out.<br>
<br>
(1) He will close his doors and will not take excessive care such as telling neighbors to close them&nbsp;<br>
with many locks. Malek-bin Dinar did not close up his doors with locks and keys,<br>
232	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
but used to tie it with rope and say : If dogs would not have entered, I would not have tied them up.<br>
(2) He will not keep such properties at home which may raise temptation of thieves. Once the ruler&nbsp;<br>
Mugirah sent some Zakat properties to Malek bin-Diner who told him : Take it. I have got no need of it.&nbsp;<br>
He said : Why? The saint said : The devil raises doubt in my mind that thiefs may take it. I don't like&nbsp;<br>
that thiefs should commit sins and my mind turns to another thing owing to the machination of the&nbsp;<br>
devil. Abu Sufiyan said hearing this: This is the weakness of the mind of a' Sufi. He adopted&nbsp;<br>
renunciation and so he can't take it.<br>
(3) At the time of going out he shall frame his mind in such a way that if even if his properties are&nbsp;<br>
taken away by thieves he would remain satisfied with the decrees of God. He should say What will be&nbsp;<br>
taken by a thief will be lawful for him or it will go in the way of God. If the thief is poor, it is a&nbsp;<br>
gift to him from me. If he is not poor, I will get benefit in three ways. Has theft will prevent him&nbsp;<br>
from committing sin. Similarly he will not commit theft in another's house if he gets my properties.<br>
(4) The forth rule is that he shall not be sorry if his property is stolen, rather he should be pleased&nbsp;<br>
and say : Had there been no good in it, God would not have taken it away. If it is gifted in the way of&nbsp;<br>
God, there should be no search about it, as he has sent it in advance for his sake. It is related that&nbsp;<br>
one camel of Hazrat Omar was stolen. He became tired of searching it. Then he said : I gift it away in&nbsp;<br>
the path of God. He entered the mosque and prayed two rakats. Then a man came and said : 0 Abdur&nbsp;<br>
Rahman, your camel lies here. He put on his shoes and said : I am seeking forgiveness from God. Then he&nbsp;<br>
sat down. He was asked : Will you not go and take your camel ? He said: I gifted it away in the path of&nbsp;<br>
God. A certain sage said : I asked a Muslim in dream after he was dead What treatment has God meted out&nbsp;<br>
to you ? He said : He forgave me and accommodated me in Paradise. The house reserved for me in Paradise&nbsp;<br>
has been given to me and I saw it. The narrator said that inspite of that he was said. I asked: You&nbsp;<br>
have been forgiven and you have entered Paradise yet why are you sad ?He heaved a sigh and said : Yes,&nbsp;<br>
I shall remain in such condition till the Resurrection day. I asked : What is its reason ? He said :&nbsp;<br>
When I was shown my place in Paradise, I was shown in the highest Paradise such a place which I have&nbsp;<br>
never seen. I was overjoyed at<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	233<br>
It<br>
it and I was about to enter there. But some one said to me : Go away from this, it is not for you. This&nbsp;<br>
is for one who keeps God's way alive. I asked : What is the meaning of keeping alive God's path ? I was&nbsp;<br>
told : You said for a thing : This is gifted in the way of God and then you accepted that thing. Had&nbsp;<br>
you filled up the path of God, I would have filled up your path.<br>
It was reported that a Derbesh slept by a man at Mecca who had a purse of money. the man got up from&nbsp;<br>
sleep and found his purse stolen. He attributed it to the Derbesh who said : How much money was there&nbsp;<br>
in your purse ? The Derbesh went to his house and paid the money to him. His friend latter on informed&nbsp;<br>
the man that out of joke they took the purse. When the Derbesh was asked to take back his money, he&nbsp;<br>
refused to take it and said Take it as lawful and good property. I will not take back the money which I&nbsp;<br>
spent in the way of God. He did not accept it. They repeatedly requested him to accept it and then he&nbsp;<br>
called his son and told him to distribute it to the poor and he did accordingly. This was the practice&nbsp;<br>
and conduct of the early sages.<br>
(5) The fifth rule is the lowest stage. He shall not curse the thief who takes his property. If he does&nbsp;<br>
that, his God-reliance is spoiled. If he feels sorry for what he missed, his renunciation is destroyed.&nbsp;<br>
The Prophet said : He who curses his oppressor, takes revenge. It is reported that a horse of Rabi bin&nbsp;<br>
Kasim was stolen. It cost him 20 thousand dirhams. He was saying his prayer at that time. He did not&nbsp;<br>
give up his prayer nor did he search for it. A company of men came to him to show sympathy. He told&nbsp;<br>
them : I saw that a thief was taking away the camel. He was asked : Why did you not catch him ? He said&nbsp;<br>
: The prayer in which I was then was dearer to me than the horse. When they began to chase the thief,&nbsp;<br>
he said : Don't pursue him talk good as I gifted it to him. A certain sage among them was asked when&nbsp;<br>
his property was stolen : Will you not curse one who oppressed you ? He said : I don't want to be a&nbsp;<br>
helper of the devil in the work. He was told Don't you wish to get back your property ? He said : I&nbsp;<br>
will not accept it, nor look to him as I gifted it to him.<br>
Another sage was told : Curse one who has oppressed you. He said: Nobody oppressed me. He oppressed his&nbsp;<br>
own soul. Is it not punishment on him? I don't want to inflict more punishment to him. Once a man was&nbsp;<br>
rebuking Hajjaj-bin-Eusuf for his oppression in presence of a certain sage. He said : Don't immerge<br>
234	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	235<br>
yourself in his rebuke as God will take revenge on Hajjaj on behalf of the man whose honour he&nbsp;<br>
destroyed.<br>
(6) The sixth rule is that he shall be sorry for the sin of the thief and for his punishment and shall&nbsp;<br>
express gatefulness to God for the reason that the owner was not made an oppressor but an oppressed one&nbsp;<br>
and for the reason that his religion has not been impaired but his world. Once a man complained to a&nbsp;<br>
learned man that his goods were robbed by a dacoit. He said : You should not feel sorry, for your goods&nbsp;<br>
went to a person who thinks that looted property is lawful as he was not given religious instruction.&nbsp;<br>
The property of Ali-bin-Fazil was stolen while he was making circuit round the Ka'ba. His father saw&nbsp;<br>
him weeping and said : Are you weeping for your property ? He said : By God, I don't weep for that, but&nbsp;<br>
I weep for the thief, as he will be asked about it on the Resurrection Day and he will have no excuse&nbsp;<br>
at that time.<br>
(4) Fourth mode of putting God-reliance into practice. There are three kinds of medicines to remove a&nbsp;<br>
disease-(1) Sure medicine. In other words, if it is used, there will be cure, for instance if the&nbsp;<br>
medicine of water is used, the disease of thirst will surely disappear. (2) Medicine by guess. By this&nbsp;<br>
medicine, a disease may be cured or may not be cured as cupping. (3) Wellknown medicine. It is neither&nbsp;<br>
certain, nor uncertain, but cure is obtained according to the attribute of a thing. It is not within&nbsp;<br>
God-reliance to give up the first kind of medicine, rather it is unlawful not to take it at the time of&nbsp;<br>
death. If the medicine of the third kind is given up, one does not go out of God-reliance, as the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet instructed a God-reliant man to give it up. The causes of the third class are charms,&nbsp;<br>
enchantments and such other things. To believe and rely on them is utter foolishness. The middle stage&nbsp;<br>
is to apply medicine after consulting physicians. This does not lessen God-reliance, nor is it&nbsp;<br>
prohibited, but it is less than sure medicine.<br>
TO TAKE MEDICINE IS NOT OPPOSED TO GODRELIANCE: This appears from the teachings and practices of the&nbsp;<br>
prophet. He said: There is no such disease as has got no medicine. He who knows it knows it and he who&nbsp;<br>
does not know it, does not know it. But death has got no medicine. The Prophet said: 0 servants of God,&nbsp;<br>
take to medicine as God created disease and also created its cure. The Prophet was asked about&nbsp;<br>
medicines and spells and enchantments: Can they annul the decree God? He said : It is also<br>
God's decree. The Prophet said in a well known tradition Whatever angels I passed by (in my journey to&nbsp;<br>
heaven) they told me: Order your followers to take to cupping. He ordered for, its extensive use. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet also said to take cupping on 17,19 and 21st day of the month, or else one may perish owing to&nbsp;<br>
blood pressure. Some say that blood pressure causes death in many cases. By order of God, it causes&nbsp;<br>
death and by its eviction, one can escape death. There is no distinction between ejection of injurious&nbsp;<br>
blood from body and to drive it out from a house. To give it up is not God reliance. It is pouring&nbsp;<br>
water upon fire in order to extinguish it or it is like preventing injury when it is about to come in a&nbsp;<br>
house. There is one tradition in which the Prophet said : He who takes cupping on Tuesday on the 17th&nbsp;<br>
of every month cures his disease of a year.<br>
<br>
He ordered many companions to use medicine. He operated upon Saad bin Muaz by taking out a vein. He&nbsp;<br>
cauterized Saad-bin Jarabah. Once there was pain in the eye of Hazrat Ali. The Prophet said to him :&nbsp;<br>
Don't eat this fresh date. Eat vegetables with bread of thin wheat. It is better for you. There was&nbsp;<br>
pain in the eye of Suhail. He saw him eating dried grapes and said : You have got pain in your eye and&nbsp;<br>
you are eating dried grapes ? He said : I am eating from another side. The Prophet smiled a little at&nbsp;<br>
his word. The Prophet used to apply collyrinth in his eye every night, take cupping every month and&nbsp;<br>
take purgative every year. He took medicine many times to cure the sting of scorpion and other animals.&nbsp;<br>
It is said that when revelation used to come to him he felt pain in his head and applied Mehdi to it.&nbsp;<br>
Sometimes he applied dried earth after it was powdered to an wound.<br>
<br>
It is reported that when once Moses fell ill, a man of Banu Israil came to him, diagnosed his disease&nbsp;<br>
and said to him : If you use this medicine you will surely recover, He said : I will not take medicine&nbsp;<br>
until I am cured without medicine. His illness as a result continued for a long time. Then the Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said to Moses There is a well-known experimented medicine for this disease. We treated it with that&nbsp;<br>
medicine and cured ourselves. He said : I will not use this medicine. So his illness began to increase.&nbsp;<br>
Then God revealed to him : By My honour and glory, I will not cure you till you use the medicine&nbsp;<br>
prescribed by the people. Then he said to them : Give me the medicine you have prescribed for me. Then&nbsp;<br>
he took the medicine and recovered. This raised doubt in<br>
236	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
his mind and then God revealed to him: You wanted to baffle My laws by relying on Me. Who else except&nbsp;<br>
myself created the quality or recovery in medicine?<br>
It is reported that when a certain prophet complained of illness, God revealed to him: Eat eggs.&nbsp;<br>
Another Prophet complained of weakness and God revealed to him: Eat meat and drink milk, as both give&nbsp;<br>
strength. It is reported that a party of men complained to their Prophet that they did not get&nbsp;<br>
beautiful children born to them. God then revealed to him : Tell them that they should give their&nbsp;<br>
pregnant women nutritious 'Safarzal' as food, as by this their children will be beautiful and they&nbsp;<br>
should give it to them on the third and fourth months of their pregnancy as God then makes their&nbsp;<br>
figure. They should give their pregnant women 'safarzal' and nutritious fresh grapes to eat. From this&nbsp;<br>
it is understood that the Creator of causes bound His laws with those who observe them in a chain, so&nbsp;<br>
that His skill may be disclosed. Medicine is a cause, which has been subdued like other causes just as&nbsp;<br>
bread is a medicine for hunger, water is a medicine for thirst. So also oxymel is a medicine for anamea&nbsp;<br>
and scammony is a medicine for purgation.<br>
If the God-reliant man look to the Creator of causes and not to the causes, medicines and physicians,&nbsp;<br>
his God-reliance is not impaired if he takes medicines. It is reported that the Prophet Moses prayed :&nbsp;<br>
0 my Lord, from whom do the diseases come and cure? God said : They come from Me. Moses said : Then why&nbsp;<br>
are physicians necessary? He said : They get their provisions by virtue of their treatment and give&nbsp;<br>
solace to the hearts of My servants. Then My cure comes or my fixed law (death)<br>
So God-reliance in the matter of medicine is an affair of knowledge and thoughts of mind. In fact to&nbsp;<br>
give up treatment is not God-reliance. In certain circumstances however, to give medicine is not&nbsp;<br>
opposed to Prophet's ways. The Prophet sometimes did not take any medicine. It is reported that Hazrat&nbsp;<br>
Abu Bakr once fell ill and he was requested to call for a physician. He said : The Physician looked to&nbsp;<br>
me and said : I will do what I like. Abu Darda was asked in his illness : What do you think? He said :&nbsp;<br>
I am thinking about my sins. He was asked : What do you hope? He said : I hope for forgiveness from my&nbsp;<br>
Lord. They said Shall we call for you a physician? He said: The Physician gave me this disease. There&nbsp;<br>
was pain in the eye of Abu Zarr. He was told :<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	237<br>
If you had called a physician, it would have been better. He said<br>
I am engaged in another affair. He was told : If you had prayed for recovery of your illness to God, it&nbsp;<br>
would 1-ave been better. He said : I pray from Him more urgent matters.<br>
Once Rabi-bin Khasim had an attack of small pox. We asked him : Take medicine. He said : I am anxious,&nbsp;<br>
I am remembering the stories of A'd . Thamud, inhabitants of the valley and other nations. How many&nbsp;<br>
physicians were there among them, but the physicians as well as the patients all perished and no chants&nbsp;<br>
and enchantments came to any use. Ahmed-bin Hambal used to say For one who believes in God-reliance and&nbsp;<br>
walks in this path, I think it is better to give up medicine and in case of his disease not to call any&nbsp;<br>
physician. Sahal Tastari was once asked : When does God-reliance of a man become purified? He said :&nbsp;<br>
His God-reliance becomes purified when injury enters into his body and loss in his property and yet he&nbsp;<br>
does not look to it.<br>
THERE ARE SEVERAL CAUSES FOR<br>
GIVING UP MEDICINE<br>
(1) The first cause is impending death. Such a person gives up medicine in fear of impending death, as&nbsp;<br>
he thinks that no medicine will be useful at that time. This fear of death sometimes comes to one in&nbsp;<br>
the form of dream, sometimes in the form of strong imagination and sometimes in the form of Khashf or&nbsp;<br>
spiritual insight, Hazrat Abu Bakr gave up medicine for this reason, as his spiritual eye was then&nbsp;<br>
opened. He told Ayesha that what was then in her mother's womb was a female child. Thereafter she gave&nbsp;<br>
birth to a female child.<br>
(2) TLe second cause is one's engagement in the thoughts of the next world and for that reason he&nbsp;<br>
forgets the pangs of his disease. Hazrat Abu Zarr said : I am engaged in other thoughts. Abu Darda said&nbsp;<br>
also in similar strain. He said : I am complaining of my sins. He was more anxious for his sins than&nbsp;<br>
for the pangs of his body. Some person asked him about what he would eat. He said : It is the&nbsp;<br>
remembrance of the Ever-living and Ever-lasling. He was asked : We asked you about maintenance of your&nbsp;<br>
human body, He said : That is knowledge. He was asked. We ask you of food. He said : Remembrance of God&nbsp;<br>
is food. They said : We ask you of such food is nourishes the body He said : What connection has it got&nbsp;<br>
with the body? Body is insignificant, withhold your<br>
238	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
hand from protecting my body. When there is every disease in the body, leave it to its Creator whether&nbsp;<br>
you have power over it or not. Have you not seen that when there is any defect in any machinery, it is&nbsp;<br>
left to its maker or manufacturer for its repair?<br>
(3) The third cause is constant and continuing disease. He who has got continuing disease and is not&nbsp;<br>
cured by any medicine, he does not take further medicines or charms and enchantments. A God reliant man&nbsp;<br>
gives up medicine in that case. To this effect, Rabi- bin Khashem said : I remember the A'd and Thamud&nbsp;<br>
tribes, there were physicians among them but they also perished with their patients.<br>
(4) The fourth cause is to think that diseases are causes of virtues,. A God-reliant man by giving up&nbsp;<br>
medicine wants to make the disease lasting as he will get rich rewards if he can have patience to bear&nbsp;<br>
it. The Prophet said with regard to the rewards of diseases and disasters. We are a company of&nbsp;<br>
Prophets. The greatest dangers and difficulties befell on us, next on the virtuous people like us, next&nbsp;<br>
on the virtous people like them. A man is tried by the degree of faith he possesses. If his faith is&nbsp;<br>
firm, dangers on him are severe. If his faith is weak, dangers on him are less. There is in the&nbsp;<br>
tradition that God will examine His servant by dangers and difficulties, as one of you examines his&nbsp;<br>
gold in fire. Some of them come out pure and free from faults like gold, some less than them, some come&nbsp;<br>
out black being burnt. The Prophet said : When God loves a man, he examines him. If he remains patient,&nbsp;<br>
He chooses him. If he remains satisfied He loves him. The Prophet said : You love to be like a strayed&nbsp;<br>
ass, so that you may not get any disease or ailment.<br>
Ibn Mas'ud said : You will see the mind of a believer sound and his body unsound and the mind of a&nbsp;<br>
hypocrite unsound and body sound.<br>
<br>
When the rewards of diseases are great, a party of believers love diseases and search them for getting&nbsp;<br>
rewards of patience. For this reason, they don't call physicians. The Prophet said : God says to His&nbsp;<br>
angels : Write for My virtuous servant his divine service, as he is tied up with My chain. If I free&nbsp;<br>
him from the tie, I will give him better flesh in place of this flesh and better blood in place of this&nbsp;<br>
blood. If I take away his life. I will take his life to attract him towards my mercy. The Prophet said&nbsp;<br>
: hose does<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	239<br>
divine service inspite of his passions, it is the best divine service. In explaining this, it has been&nbsp;<br>
said : The divine service which a man does in his illness and dangers is the best. This can be guessed&nbsp;<br>
from the following verse : Perchance you hate a thing which is better for you.<br>
<br>
Hazrat Sahal Tastari used to say : It is better to be unable to do divine service as a result of giving&nbsp;<br>
up medicine than to take medicine to gain strength for divine service. He had a serious disease for&nbsp;<br>
which he did not take medicine. Whenever he saw a person unable to pray standing and doing good deeds&nbsp;<br>
owing to illness and for which he took medicine to gain strength he expressed wonder and said : It is&nbsp;<br>
better for this man to pray sitting and to remain satisfied in his condition than to gain strength by&nbsp;<br>
taking medicine in order to pray standing. The people of Basara used to make their passions weak by&nbsp;<br>
hunger to curb temptation, as they knew that a little action of mind, such as patience and&nbsp;<br>
God-reliance, is better than a mountain like actions of bodily limbs. Disease does not prevent the&nbsp;<br>
working of mind. Sahal Tastari said : Physical disease is good but mental disease is bad.<br>
<br>
(5) Fifth cause. It is to believe that sins are compensated by diseases. Some people commit many sins&nbsp;<br>
and fear much and abstain from taking medicine for diseases for making expiations for their sins. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said : Fever and other diseases continue to come to a man owing to his sins till he travels in&nbsp;<br>
the earth like a virtuous man free from sins and faults. There is in the tradition that the fever of&nbsp;<br>
one day expiates the sins of a year. Some people explain its reason by saying that fever destroys the&nbsp;<br>
strength of a year. Some say that a man has got 360 glands. Fever enters into each gland and therefore&nbsp;<br>
one feels pain. So every pain in each gland expiates the sins of one day. When the Prophet mentioned&nbsp;<br>
the expiation of sin by fever, Zaid-bin-Sabet prayed for lasting fever. As a result his fever continued&nbsp;<br>
till he died. Some Ansars prayed similarly. The Prophet said : God is not pleased with anything but&nbsp;<br>
Paradise for one whose two eyes has been robbed by Him. Some Ansars wished therefore to become blind.&nbsp;<br>
The Prophet Jesus Christ said : He who does not remain satisfied with diseases and economic&nbsp;<br>
difficulties with hope of expiation of sins can not become wise. It is reported that the Prophet Moses&nbsp;<br>
prayed to God on seeing a man in a great distress : 0 Lord, show mercy on him. God said: How can I show&nbsp;<br>
mercy on him ? I am<br>
240	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
showing mercy on him by giving him this distress. In other words I am expiating his sins and increasing&nbsp;<br>
his ranks.<br>
(6) Sixth cause. It is to believe that health breeds greed. pride and other evils. A man by virtue of&nbsp;<br>
his continued sound health may have in his mind pride ungratefulness and low desires. For this reason a&nbsp;<br>
religious man gives up medicine. So that idleness, pride and other evils may not come to him. Health is&nbsp;<br>
the name of natural strength. Greed arises out of health and when it is high, commission of sin becomes&nbsp;<br>
easy. The lowest danger of health is to lose time uselessly by engaging oneself in happiness. When God&nbsp;<br>
wishes good for a servant. He warns him by diseases, dangers and difficulties. For this reason, a&nbsp;<br>
certain sage said : A believer is not free from diseases, wants and disgrace. The Prophet said God says&nbsp;<br>
: Proverty is my prison and disease is my chain. I inflict a servant whom I love with these. When there&nbsp;<br>
is prevention of sin in disease, what greater good can there be than this ? There is peace of mind in&nbsp;<br>
giving up of sins. A certain religions man asked a man : How are you? He said : I am in peace of mind.&nbsp;<br>
He said : If you have not committed sins, you are then in peace of mind. If you have committed sins,&nbsp;<br>
then what disease is greater than sins ? He who commits sins is deprived of good.<br>
Hazrat Ali saw a tribe of Nabatis in Iraq dressed gorgeously on an I'd day and asked them : Why are&nbsp;<br>
these gorgeous dresses? They said : They day in which we do not commit sins is the day of our festival.&nbsp;<br>
God said : Surely man is inordinate, as he thinks himself free from want. In other words, he does not&nbsp;<br>
care anything as a result of his living in peace.<br>
A certain sage said : Pharaoh lived for 400 years. During this long ,period, he had not even an attack&nbsp;<br>
of headache, nor the change of even a gland. For the reason of this continued happiness, he said : I am&nbsp;<br>
your highest Lord-79: 24. He claimed himself to be God Had he suffered even half headache for a day, he&nbsp;<br>
would have kept himself busy for that and he could not have claimed to be God. The Prophet said :&nbsp;<br>
Remember much what destroys happiness (death). It is said that fever is a messenger of death. It&nbsp;<br>
reminds death and keeps one away from useless things. God says : Don't your see that they are put to&nbsp;<br>
test once or twice a year and yet they are not repentant and do not remember God? This test is meant to&nbsp;<br>
be diseases. It is said what when a man is affected twice a year by diseases and yet does not become<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	241<br>
repentant, the angel of death says to him : 0 careless one, messenger after messenger came to you from&nbsp;<br>
me but you did not respond to them. For this reason, the ancient sages became anxious when any disease&nbsp;<br>
or loss of life or property did not come to them even after expiry of a year. They said: A believer&nbsp;<br>
does not become free from fear or disaster in every 40 days.<br>
It is reported that Hazrat Ammar-b-Yaser married a woman and after this it appeared that the woman&nbsp;<br>
never fell ill. For this reason, he divorced her. The Prophet consented to marry a woman as she had&nbsp;<br>
many qualities. He was also told that she had never any disease. The Prophet said : I have got no&nbsp;<br>
necessity for such a woman. Once there was mention of disease and headache before the Prophet and a man&nbsp;<br>
said : I don't know what headache is. The Prophet then said : Go away from me. Let one who wished to&nbsp;<br>
see an inmate of Hell look at this man. The Prophet said : Fever is a portion of a believer's hell.&nbsp;<br>
Hazrat Anas and Hazrat Ayesha asked the Prophet : 0 Messenger of God, will there be any man with the&nbsp;<br>
martyrs on the Resurrection day ? He said : Yes, a man who remembers death twenty times a day. It is&nbsp;<br>
beyond doubt that a diseases man remembers death much. When the benefits of diseases are numerous a&nbsp;<br>
party of saints gave up efforts to remove diseases.<br>
It is improper to say that to give up medicine is good in all circumstances. It is said that to take&nbsp;<br>
medicine is the condition of those who have got weak faith and to give up medicine is the condition of&nbsp;<br>
those who have got firm faith and God-reliance. They say that God reliant men will give up cupping and&nbsp;<br>
other medicines. If it is true. It is also true that if a serpent enters a wearing apparel, he should&nbsp;<br>
not remove it. It can also be said that he should not take water to remove thirst or food to remove&nbsp;<br>
hunger.<br>
To go to places of epidemics is improper. Reports about epidemics have come from Hazrat Omar and other&nbsp;<br>
companions. When they reached the outskirts of Syria, news reached them that plague and cholera in&nbsp;<br>
virulent type broke out there. There were two groups among them. One group said : We shall not enter&nbsp;<br>
this city to face destruction. Another group said : We shall enter this city depending upon God, we&nbsp;<br>
shall not flee away from the decree of God and avoid death or else we shall be like those peoples about&nbsp;<br>
whom God said : Have you not seen those people<br>
242	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	243<br>
who went out of their houses for fear of death in thousands ? They therefore went to Hazrat Omar and&nbsp;<br>
sought his opinion. He said : We shall return and shall not enter this city infected with epidemics.&nbsp;<br>
Those who opposed this idea said to him : Shall we flee away from the decree of God ? Hazrat Omar said&nbsp;<br>
: Yes, we shall flee away from the decree of God and return to the decree of God. He then cited an&nbsp;<br>
illustration for them and said : Don't you consider where one, having sheep and two fields for grazing&nbsp;<br>
them, one full of green grass and another full of sands free from grass and leaves, shall graze them ?&nbsp;<br>
They said : Yes, we have understood it. They then went to Abdur Rahman who was not present there. In&nbsp;<br>
the morning he came and Hazrat Omar asked his opinion about it. He said : 0 Commander of the faithful,&nbsp;<br>
I heard a Hadis about it from the Messenger of God. Hazrat Omar exclaimed : God is greatest Hazrat&nbsp;<br>
Abdur Rahman said :: I heard the Prophet say : When you hear about epidemics anywhere, don't-come to&nbsp;<br>
it. If you are in the place infected with epidemics, don't' go out of it. At this, Hazrat Omar became&nbsp;<br>
pleased and offered thanks to God and said : My opinion is supported by Hadis. Then he returned from&nbsp;<br>
that place with his companions. All the companions agreed on this Hadis and went away. From this it&nbsp;<br>
appears that God-reliance does not go by this act, rather it is a high stage of God-reliance.<br>
<br>
Question. Why did the Prophet prohibit to go out of the infected place ? In the medical rules, air is&nbsp;<br>
the cause of epidemics. Why did he not give permission to go out of it?<br>
<br>
Answer. Know. 0 dear readers, that there are no two opinions that there is no prohibition to flee away&nbsp;<br>
from injurious things. In this matter, to give up God-reliance is lawful. But it does not show the path&nbsp;<br>
to reach the goal. God knows that the air does not injure the body when it touches it, but foul air&nbsp;<br>
breathed constanly may injure health. In other words, when the air becomes polluted and one inhales and&nbsp;<br>
exhales it for a long time, it enters into a healthy body. It does not not come out till the inner body&nbsp;<br>
is affected by it. In that condition any man living long in a place infected with epidemics, may be&nbsp;<br>
affected by it. If the Prophet would have given permission to the people of the place infected with&nbsp;<br>
epidemics to go -out, there would have been no persons there except the patients, whose condition would&nbsp;<br>
have been miserable for want of nursing and care. The Muslims are<br>
like a building whose one part strengthens the other. The believers are like one body. If one part is&nbsp;<br>
attacked, the other parts also respond. This is one of the reasons of prohibition.<br>
Question. It is seen from above that there is good in giving up medicine. Then why did not the Prophet&nbsp;<br>
give up medicine in order to gain merits?<br>
Answer Togive up medicine is good for the man whose sins are many and which require expiation. This was&nbsp;<br>
contrary to the case of the Prophet who was sinless and pure. He came as a world teacher to teach the&nbsp;<br>
people in all matters. Therefore he taught the people to take medicine in case of illness. It is,&nbsp;<br>
however, more perfect to know that stone and gold are the same than to flee away from them. This was&nbsp;<br>
exactly the case with the Prophet and thereby his God-reliance did not lessen.<br>
The condition of God-reliant man in disclosing or suppressing disease. Know, 0 readers, that to&nbsp;<br>
suppress disease, poverty or other disasters is included with the hidden treasures like good works.&nbsp;<br>
That is the highest stage, as to remain satisfied with the decree of God, to remain patient at the&nbsp;<br>
dangers anddifficulties sent by Him and to keep secret the affairs between him and God can save him&nbsp;<br>
from many dangers. Inspite of this, there is no harm in disclosing them if his intention and goal&nbsp;<br>
remain fixed. In three cases, disease can be expressed. (1) To take medicine. It is necessary to take&nbsp;<br>
medicine from the physician after disclosing the disease to him. This should not be in the way of*&nbsp;<br>
complaint but to state what has been sent by God to him. Hazrat Bashar Hafi used to .tell of his&nbsp;<br>
disease to the physician Abdur Rahman. Imam Ahmad disclosed his disease and said : I am saying of God's&nbsp;<br>
power which appeared in me. (2) To acquire patience and gratefulness. In addition to physician, one may&nbsp;<br>
disclose his diseases to saints and sages with the object of learning from them good patienee and good&nbsp;<br>
gratefulness in diseases Hazrat Hasan Basri said : When a patient praises God and expresses&nbsp;<br>
gratefulness to Him and then remembers his disease his complaint disappears. (3) The third object is to&nbsp;<br>
attribute power to God. Disease can be disclosed with the object of expressing one's inability and&nbsp;<br>
failure on the one hand and appreciating the power of God on the other. I its reported that Hazrat Ali&nbsp;<br>
was asked once about the condition of his disease. He said : I am not well. One of them began to&nbsp;<br>
look-at another. They<br>
<br>
244	TAUHID AND TAWAKKAL	Vol-IV<br>
<br>
did not like the expression and began to think why he complained. Then Hazrat Ali said : Can there be&nbsp;<br>
expression of pride before the Almighty God ? I like more to express my inability and weakness before&nbsp;<br>
Him. Once Hazrat Ali fell ill. The Prophet heard him say : 0 God, give me patience over my danger. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said to him: Have you wanted danger from God? Pray for peace from Him. There is permission of&nbsp;<br>
disclosing disease with this object. To complain to God with other objects is unlawful. Patience is&nbsp;<br>
good, It was said in explaining it that there is complain in it. Hazrat Eakub was asked : Who has&nbsp;<br>
robbed you of your eye-sight? He said : Bitterness of time and long sorrows. God then sent revelation&nbsp;<br>
to him : Have you got an opportunity of complaining against Me to My servant? He said : 0 Lord, I am&nbsp;<br>
repenting to Thee. Taus and Muzahed said : The cries of a patient at the time of his disease are&nbsp;<br>
written. The wise men did not like that a patient should raise a cry as it is a form of complaint.&nbsp;<br>
Hazrat Ayub raised cries of agony at the time of his disease. The devil expressed satisfaction at this.&nbsp;<br>
The Prophet said : When a man fall ill, God sends two angels saying: Look to what he says. If he&nbsp;<br>
praises God and glorifies Him, pray from him. If he complains and speaks evil, tell him like that.<br>

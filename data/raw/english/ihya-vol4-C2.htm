CHAPTER II<br>
PATIENCE AND GRATEFT?LNESS<br>
MERITS OF PATIENCE<br>
Quran: God praised those who adopt patience and mentioned about patience more than several times in the&nbsp;<br>
Quran. He kept most good deeds and merits linked with patience. God says: When they kept patience, I&nbsp;<br>
created leaders from amongst them who showed guidance according to My instruction -32 : 24. God says:&nbsp;<br>
Owing to the patience of Banu Israil, the words of your Lord were perfected well over them. God says: I&nbsp;<br>
will reward those for their good works who are patient. God say: They will be given double rewards for&nbsp;<br>
their patience. God says: The patient will_ be given rewards fully without accounts. God says: Fasting&nbsp;<br>
is only for Me and I will give its rewards. He kept connection with those having patience with Himself&nbsp;<br>
and promised that He is with the patient. God says: Take to patience, God is with the patient - 2 :&nbsp;<br>
249. God says: If you keep patience and fear God 	 your Lord will help you with five thousand&nbsp;<br>
well armed angels. God says: There are blessings and mercy upon them from their Lord and they are those&nbsp;<br>
who are guided-2:58.<br>
Hadis: - The Prophet said: Patience is half of faith. He said: The lowest measure of what you have been&nbsp;<br>
given is sure faith and firm determination of patience. He who has been given a portion of these two&nbsp;<br>
qualities has got no fear even if he prays little at night and fasts little during day time. If you can&nbsp;<br>
stand with firm foot with patience just as you are now and do not turn away from this way, it is dear&nbsp;<br>
to me. If anybody does divine service equal to all of you after turning away from patience, it will not&nbsp;<br>
be dear to me. I fear the world will be opened to you after me. You will then cherish hatreu'&quot;'for one&nbsp;<br>
another and the dwellers of heaven will then be dissatisfied with you. He who keeps patience and&nbsp;<br>
expects reward, will get. full reward. Then he recited this verse: What is near you will come to an end&nbsp;<br>
and what is near God will only remain. I will give full rewards to those who being patient do good&nbsp;<br>
works -16 : 96.<br>
It is reported from Hazrat Jaber that a man asked the Prophet about faith and he said: That is patience&nbsp;<br>
and forbearance. The Prophet said: Patience is a jewel among the jewels of Paradise.<br>
62<br>
The Prophet was once asked: What is faith? He said: Patience.<br>
This is just like his saying: Pilgrimage is Arafat. This means that<br>
the great pillar of pilgrimage is to wait at Arafat. Similarly the<br>
general pillar of faith is patience. The Prophet said: To say<br>
against what passion dictates is the best act. God sent revelation<br>
to David: Follow My conduct. One of my conduct is that I have<br>
great patience. The Prophet once went to the Ansars and asked:<br>
Are you believers? They remained silent. Hazrat Omar submitted: 0 Messenger of God, we are believers.&nbsp;<br>
He asked: What is the sign of your faith? They said: We are grateful both in joys and sorrows, keep&nbsp;<br>
patience in dangers and difficulties and remain satisfied at what was pre-measured. The Prophet said:&nbsp;<br>
By the Lord of Ka'ba, you are then really believers. Prophet Jesus Christ said: You cannot earn what&nbsp;<br>
you love till you keep patience at what you do not love. The Prophet said: Had patience been given the&nbsp;<br>
form of man, it would have been kind. God loves the patient.<br>
Sayings of the wise: Hazrat Omar wrote to Abu Musa Ash'ari: Take to patience. Know that patience is of&nbsp;<br>
two kinds, one is better than the other. It is good to have patience at disaster but better than this&nbsp;<br>
is to protect oneself from unlawful things. Know that patience is the gist of faith. The reason is that&nbsp;<br>
God fear is the greatest religious act and that is gained by patience. Hazrat Ali said: Faith is built&nbsp;<br>
upon four things-sure faith, patience, Jihad and good judgment. He said also: Patience is to faith just&nbsp;<br>
as head is to body. He who has got no head has got no body. Similarly he who has got no patience has&nbsp;<br>
got no faith. Hazrat Omar said: Iman has got two burdens - blessings and mercy. This appears from the&nbsp;<br>
following verse - 2: 157. On them is blessing from their Lord and mercy and they are those who are&nbsp;<br>
guided. We found him patient. How good is the servant as he is most repentant. Hazrat Abu Darda'a said:&nbsp;<br>
To remain patient at commands and to remain satisfied with fate is the best rank of faith.<br>
REAL KNOWLEDGE AND MEANING OF PATIENCE<br>
Know, 0 reader, that patience is an important stage of religion and a station for the so journers in&nbsp;<br>
the path of religion. The stages of religion are controlled by three matters - knowledge, condition and&nbsp;<br>
action. Knowledge is the root and condition arises out of knowledge and action is the fruit of&nbsp;<br>
condition. So knowledge is like a tree, conditions are its branches<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	63<br>
and actions are its fruits. These three matters are engrained in all<br>
the stages of one who walks in the path of religion. Patience is an<br>
attribute of man only and angels, birds and beasts have no such<br>
attribute. An angel has got no necessity of patience as he has got<br>
no no nature of evil. Lower animals are guided by instincts and greed. They have got no need for&nbsp;<br>
patience. The angels are always<br>
immerged in love of God and they have got no evil propensities. Man has got animal propensities in his&nbsp;<br>
infancy. Then he feels greed for food, then desire for plays and sports, then desire for marriage&nbsp;<br>
comes. At first he has got no power for patience, then after dawn of intellect clashes begin and at&nbsp;<br>
that time patience is necessary. At the time of maturity he is placed under two angels. One shows him&nbsp;<br>
the path of guidance and another gives his strength. By these two angels, he is raised from a lower&nbsp;<br>
animal to the rank of a man. At that time, he is given two qualities - one quality is that of the&nbsp;<br>
knowledge of God and His Prophet and another is knowledge the knowledge of good on consideration of the&nbsp;<br>
ultimate good. These two things are gained from the two angels of guidance and knowledge. A lower&nbsp;<br>
animal has got no knowledge or consideration for the ultimate good. It is guided by present happiness.&nbsp;<br>
Man knows by the light of guidance that he will suffer in the end if guided by low desires but that is&nbsp;<br>
not even sufficient to remove evils. There are many injurious things which he cannot remove for want of&nbsp;<br>
strength. So to remove the disease of low desires, strength is necessary with which he fights with low&nbsp;<br>
desires and greed. For that, God places another angel who helps him and gives him strength to control&nbsp;<br>
greed like an unseen soldier. Then fight ensues between the angel of greed and the angel of suppression&nbsp;<br>
of greed. This struggle ensues between these two forces. Mind is the battle field. Inspiration for good&nbsp;<br>
comes from the angel and propensities of passion come from the devil. To establish the instinct of&nbsp;<br>
good, patience is necessary which control the propensities of evil. If patience is acquired, there&nbsp;<br>
comes Marfat or knowledge of God which is the cause of fortune in the next world and in this world. The&nbsp;<br>
knowledge of God which is deep rooted is called faith or Iman. The above two angels are within the&nbsp;<br>
control of two angels called Keraman Katebin or honourable writers. They are entrusted to every man.&nbsp;<br>
They write sins and virtues in the pages of mind called Records of deeds or Amalnama.<br>
<br>
This record of deeds will be opened twice-once at the time of death and then on the Judgement Day. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said: When a<br>
PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
64	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
person dies, his resurrection occurs. He remains alone at that time and he is said: You will come to me&nbsp;<br>
alone as I have created you first. He is then said: Your soul is enough in rendering accounts. On the&nbsp;<br>
great day of Resurrection, he will be presented. among the people.<br>
PATIENCE IS HALF OF FAITH: There are two reasons and two necessities to show that patience is half of&nbsp;<br>
faith. The first reason is to confirm the basic principle of religion and to act according to it. There&nbsp;<br>
in there are two pillars of faith sure faith and patience. The meaning of sure faith is&nbsp;<br>
immutableknowledge which God shows to a man about the fundamental principles of Islam. The meaning of&nbsp;<br>
patience is action to the requirements of the immutable faith. This grows knowledge that sin is&nbsp;<br>
injurious and virtue is beneficial and to give up sin and to gain virtue are not possible without&nbsp;<br>
patience. Patience is to put in to action &amp;.h,, inclination of virtue after suppression ression of evil&nbsp;<br>
propensities. In this angle of vision, patience is half of faith. For this reason, the Prophet&nbsp;<br>
mentioned patience and faith together. He said: You have been given but little of sure faith and&nbsp;<br>
patience.<br>
(2) Second Reason. Faith arises out of knowledge which again arises out of the good deeds of a man.&nbsp;<br>
Man's actions are divided into two what is beneficial both is this world and in the next and what is&nbsp;<br>
injurious in both the worlds. Patience is necessary about what is injurious to men in both the worlds&nbsp;<br>
and gratefulness is necessary about what is beneficial in both the worlds. In this view, gratefulness&nbsp;<br>
is half of faith. Ibn Masud said: Iman is divided into two - patience and gratefulness.<br>
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PATIENCE: The first kind is to have patience over physical pains, such as patience&nbsp;<br>
in the difficult tasks of divine services and in the sudden accidents and dangers such as severe&nbsp;<br>
beating and serious disease. If patience is observed according to the dictates of religion, it is&nbsp;<br>
praise-worthy. The second kind is to have patience at the inclination of evil and greed of passion. To&nbsp;<br>
have patience at the greed of belly and sexual passion is named Afat or self-control. Bravery is&nbsp;<br>
patience is battles. Forbearance is patience by appeasement of anger: Expansion of breast is patience&nbsp;<br>
at turns of fortunes. Renunciation is patience from happiness and pleasures. Satisfaction is patience&nbsp;<br>
at present possessions. Most conducts of faith lie in patiences. For this reason, when the Prophet was&nbsp;<br>
asked about faith, he<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	65<br>
replied that patience is faith as there is no act of faith more difficult than patience. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said: Pilgrimage is Arafat. in other words the acts of Arafat are more difficult out of the actions of&nbsp;<br>
pilgrimage. To forbear all these hardships is called patience. God says: Those who keep patience in&nbsp;<br>
dangers, wants and struggles are the truthful ones and they are also the God fearing ones.<br>
<br>
PATIENCE IN CONSIDERATION OF STRENGTH<br>
AND WEAKNESS<br>
(a) To control the evil inclinations of nature requires the constant exercise of patience. Their&nbsp;<br>
numbers are few and they say: God is our Lord and they are firm in this. They are the truthful ones.&nbsp;<br>
They are addressed by God as thus: 0 satisfied soul, return to thy Lord well-pleased with Him and&nbsp;<br>
well-pleasing Him-89:28.<br>
(b) To surrender to the forces of devil and all inclinations towards religion are routed. They are the&nbsp;<br>
heedless ones and their numbers are many. The enemies of God rule over their souls. God says about&nbsp;<br>
them: I would have guided everyone had I wished, but My promise will come out true: I will fill up Hell&nbsp;<br>
with man and jinn - 9:112. God says regarding them: Turn away from those who turn away from My&nbsp;<br>
remembrance and who do not wish except the pleasure of this world's life. The signs of this life are&nbsp;<br>
despair and hopelessness. For that reason, the Prophet said: Wise is he who humbles himself and acts&nbsp;<br>
for what will come after death and fool is he who follows his low desires and hopes<br>
against God.<br>
(c) To continue struggles between two forces-forces of good and forces of evil. Sometimes the forces of&nbsp;<br>
good prevail and sometimes forces of evil. Such a man has mixed up good with<br>
evil.<br>
PATIENCE IN CONSIDERATION OF SEVERITY AND EASE: The first kind of patience is not acquired without&nbsp;<br>
great efforts and the second kind of patience does not require such efforts. God says: He who gives&nbsp;<br>
charity and fears God and takes to patience and considers good as good, I shall make his path easy - 92&nbsp;<br>
: 7. The practice of patience leads to contentment which is therefore higher than patience. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said: Do divine service with contentment. If you are unable to do it, there is<br>
66	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
abundant good in keeping patience in fighting with your baser self. A friend of God said: A patient man&nbsp;<br>
stands on three stages. In the first stage, he gives up following his baser self. In the second stage,&nbsp;<br>
he remains satisfied with his fate and this is the rank of one who renounces the world. In the third&nbsp;<br>
stage, he likes what his Master does about him and this is the rank of the truthful and this is the&nbsp;<br>
stage of love. The stage of love is higher than that of contenment and the stage of contentment is&nbsp;<br>
higher than that of patience.<br>
<br>
PATIENCE IN CONSIDERATION OF LAWS: Patience is divided into compulsory optional, unlawful and&nbsp;<br>
abominable things in consideration of laws. To keep patience from unlawful things is compulsory and to&nbsp;<br>
keep patience from the abominable things is optional. To keep patience at a difficulty which is<br>
prohibiteA is alcn prohibited 1.1P is HIP a man whn keens<br>
patience seeing that his hand is being cut off, or the hand of his son is being cut off, or he is like&nbsp;<br>
a man who keeps patience even seeing that a stranger is cohabiting with his wife. Such kind of patience&nbsp;<br>
is unlawful. So patience is sometimes good and sometimes bad.<br>
<br>
CASES IN WHICH PATIENCE IS GOOD: There are two kinds of things which a man has to face in this world,&nbsp;<br>
things which are conformable to his nature and things which are against his nature. In both these&nbsp;<br>
things, patience is necessary. Things which are conformable to nature are physical health, safety,&nbsp;<br>
properties and wealth, name and fame, great number of followers and helpers. To keep patience a t these&nbsp;<br>
worldly things is necessary as he who throws himself to enjoy these things without control keeps&nbsp;<br>
himself busy in sins. A wise man said: A believer can keep patience in untoward circumstances but&nbsp;<br>
nobody other than a truthful man can keep patience in pleasures and happiness. The saint Sahal_.&nbsp;<br>
Tastari said: To keep patience in pleasures and happiness is more difficult than to keep patience in&nbsp;<br>
disasters. When the treasures of the world fell into the hands of the companioi , they said: We have&nbsp;<br>
been tried with various kinds of dangers and difficulties and we kept patience over them. But now we&nbsp;<br>
are being tried with wealth and riches and we can't keep patience about them. For this reason the&nbsp;<br>
Almighty warned us from the following things. God says: 0 believers, let not your property or your&nbsp;<br>
children keep you forgetful from the<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	67<br>
remembrance of God -63 : 9. God says: There are enemies for you amongst your wives and children. So be&nbsp;<br>
careful of them - 64: 14. The Prophet said: Children are the causes of miserliness, cowardice and&nbsp;<br>
sorrows. When the Prophet saw his grandson Hasan coming towards him drawing up his clothes, he&nbsp;<br>
descended from his pulpit, lifted him up and said: God has truly said: Your properties and your&nbsp;<br>
children are trials for you. When I saw my grandson faltering, I could not help but lift him up. There&nbsp;<br>
are lessons from this for the wise men. He who can keep patience at pleasures and happiness is called a&nbsp;<br>
real man. The meaning of patience from pleasures and happiness is not to be addicted to these things.&nbsp;<br>
Such a man thinks that everything has been kept as trust to him and soon he shall have to return it. He&nbsp;<br>
does not let himself swayed by the strain of happiness and does not keep himself engaged in sports and&nbsp;<br>
plays, enjoyments and happiness.<br>
He spends his properties and wealth in the wa of God a_d<br>
.- - -r--	r..,-t, ...-_ -&quot;- 	1-y Y &quot;. VVU, allu<br>
towards fulfillment of his duties towards God and His creations. He fulfills the duties of his tongue&nbsp;<br>
by delivering sermons and speaking truths and the duties of his body by physically helping others.<br>
2. Patience at things against nature: This patience is divided into three classes,- (a) patience at&nbsp;<br>
things within the control of man, such as divine service, giving up sin etc, (b) patience which is out&nbsp;<br>
of control of man, such as natural calamities, dangers and difficulties (c) and patience at a thing in&nbsp;<br>
which a man has got no freedom but he can remove it, such as removing the difficulty of man by&nbsp;<br>
avenging. With regard to the subjects within control of man, they are sub-divided into two. The first&nbsp;<br>
sub- division includes such divine services in which patience is necessary. To have patience in divine&nbsp;<br>
services is difficult, as nature does not want to be slave but loves to be master. For this reason, a&nbsp;<br>
certain sage said : There is no such man who does not say. what Pharaoh said : I am your biggest lord.&nbsp;<br>
There is no such man who does not say this kind of words with his servants, slaves and persons&nbsp;<br>
subordinate to him. As the serfdom of body is difficult, so also divine service is difficult. One is&nbsp;<br>
not willing to serve God by prayer and other services owing to idleness and to pay zakat and other&nbsp;<br>
charities owing to miserliness. It is difficult to do divine service through pilgrimage and jihad and&nbsp;<br>
owing to idleness and miserliness. A worshiper feels necessity of this patience under three&nbsp;<br>
circumstances. Firstly by having patience in divine<br>
68	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
<br>
services, such as to make motive sincere, to free himself from the evil of show, to determine firmly to&nbsp;<br>
do sincere deeds. The Prophet said : All actions are based on motive and everyone gets what he intends&nbsp;<br>
for. God says : They are not ordered but to do divine service being sincere to Him. For this reason,&nbsp;<br>
God preceded patience before actions saying : Those who have patience and do good deeds. Secondly,&nbsp;<br>
patience in divine services, such as observing rules of Shariat in worship, restraining oneself in evil&nbsp;<br>
actions and thoughts in the midst of prayer and to remain attentive to the thoughts of God. The third,&nbsp;<br>
circumstance is to have patience after divine service, such as patience from broadcasting it to the&nbsp;<br>
people, from restraining oneself from a desire of getting honour. God says :.Don't make your action&nbsp;<br>
void. He says : Don't make your charitable actions void by harsh treatment and rebuke- 2:264.<br>
SECOND SUBDIVISION<br>
Patience in sinful actions-To restrain oneself from sinful deeds means patience in sinful deeds. The&nbsp;<br>
necessity of such patience is beyond description. God prohibits sinful deeds in this verse : He&nbsp;<br>
prohibits you from obscene and abominable actions and rebellion-16 : 90. The Prophet said : The refugee&nbsp;<br>
is one who gives up evil deeds and Mujahid is one who fights with his passion. Sin is committed if one&nbsp;<br>
acts according to the promptings of his passions. If habit is added to passion, two enemies of devil&nbsp;<br>
stand against the party of God. Under this circumstance, only inspiration of religion is not sufficient&nbsp;<br>
and not strong enough to control it, such as backbiting, telling falsehood, self- praise, to<br>
take pride etc.<br>
The objects of tee second class are things out of control of man. Though these subjects are not under&nbsp;<br>
control, yet a man can remove them. If anybody gives trouble to another by his words and deeds,&nbsp;<br>
patience is sometimes compulsory in such a case and not to take retaliation and sometimes it is&nbsp;<br>
regarded as additional virtuous act. A certain companion said : If anybody cannot have patience at the&nbsp;<br>
trouble inflicted by another, he can't regard his faith as real faith. God says : We shall certainly&nbsp;<br>
have patience at what they trouble us with those who rely on God. Once the Prophet was distributing&nbsp;<br>
alms among the poor and the distressed. A certain desert Arab said to him at that time: By this&nbsp;<br>
distribution God, pleasure is not sought. When the Prophet was<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	69',<br>
informed of this, his two cheeks turned red and then he said May God show mercy on my brother Moses. He&nbsp;<br>
suffered more than this and he took patience. God says : Leave the trouble inflicted by them and rely&nbsp;<br>
on God-33 : 48 . God says : Have patience at what they say and leave them a good leave-73 : 10. God&nbsp;<br>
says : I know that your heart is saddended at what they say. Do glorify your Lord-5 : 98. God says :&nbsp;<br>
You will certainly hear many words troubling you from the People of the Book and polytheists. If you&nbsp;<br>
can have patience at that and fear God, it will be an act of bravery-3 : 186. For this reason, God&nbsp;<br>
praised those who restrain themselves from taking revenge. God says : If you take revenge (for&nbsp;<br>
religion), inflict such trouble as has been inflicted on you, but if you take to patience, there are&nbsp;<br>
abundant good for the patient-16: 126. The Prophet said : Join the tie with one who severs it from you.&nbsp;<br>
Give charity to one who deprives you. Forgive one who oppresses you. I saw in the Injil in which Jesus&nbsp;<br>
said : You have been said before : Take a tooth for a tooth and a nose for a nose, but I say to you :&nbsp;<br>
Don't do harm in lieu of harm but turn your left cheek to one who slaps your right cheek. Give pour&nbsp;<br>
cloth to one who takes your shirt. Walk with one two miles with his load who takes you to one mile with&nbsp;<br>
his load.' These are instructions for patience at the injuries inflicted by others. So high merits are&nbsp;<br>
obtained through patience.<br>
Third class of patience which is outside human control. Examples of such patience are sudden mishaps,&nbsp;<br>
dangers, pangs of death, loss of health owing to illness, loss of eye sight. Hazrat Ibn Abbas said:&nbsp;<br>
There are news of three kinds of patience in the Holy Quran - (1) to have patience in doing compulsory&nbsp;<br>
things ordained by God, (2) to keep oneself away from the forbidden things of God, (3) and to have&nbsp;<br>
patience at sudder&quot; dangers and difficulties. Good merits are obtained for such patience. Every&nbsp;<br>
believer can have patience at unlawful things but it is only the prophets who can have patience at the&nbsp;<br>
natural calamities. For this reason, the Prophet said: 0 God, I pray to you to grant me such firm faith&nbsp;<br>
as can make dangers and difficulties from Thee easy on me. It is understood from this that sure faith&nbsp;<br>
is linked with patience. (1) Abu Solaiman said: By God, we can't have patience at what we love. How can&nbsp;<br>
we then have patience at what we do not love? (2) The Holy Prophet said: God says: When I send on My&nbsp;<br>
servant any physical, economic or family trouble and if he forbears it, I will feel shame to set up for&nbsp;<br>
him balance and<br>
70	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	71<br>
measure on the Resurrection Day. (3) The Prophet said: To await with patience for release from a danger&nbsp;<br>
is included within divine service. He also said: If a servant prays with the following according to the&nbsp;<br>
order of God after falling in a danger, his prayer is accepted: We are surely for God and to Him we&nbsp;<br>
shall return. 0 God, give me blessing in my danger and leave good behind it. (4) Hazrat Anas said: That&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said that God said: 0 Gabriel, do you know what reward I give to one whose eyes I have robbed?&nbsp;<br>
He says: 0 God, we don't know anything except what You have taught us. God said: Its reward is his&nbsp;<br>
constant living in My abode and his look towards My face. (5) The Prophet said: God says: When I&nbsp;<br>
examine a servant with a trial and he keeps patience at that and does not complain of Me to his&nbsp;<br>
visitors, I give him better flesh in lieu of his former flesh and better blood in lieu of his former&nbsp;<br>
blood. When I cure him, I cure him after forgiving his sins. (6) Hazrat Daud prayed once: 0 Lord what&nbsp;<br>
is the reward of a<br>
r-°yed<br>
person who keeps patience at his dangers by seeking' your pleasure? God said: His reward is this that I&nbsp;<br>
will dress him with the dress of faith and will never take it from him. (7) The Caliph Omar bin Abdul&nbsp;<br>
&#149;Aziz once addressed the people thus: If God takes away a gift which He gave to a person, He gives him&nbsp;<br>
a gift better than his previous gift provided he keeps patience. Then he read this verse: The patient&nbsp;<br>
will be given full reward without account. (8) When the saint Fazil was asked about patience, he said:&nbsp;<br>
To keep satisfied with the decree of God is patience. He was asked: How is that? He replied: The&nbsp;<br>
satisfied man does not expect rank more than his rank. (9) It is narrated that when Shibli was&nbsp;<br>
imprisoned at Maristan, some people met him. He asked them: Who are you? They said: Your friends. We&nbsp;<br>
have come to meet you. He then stoned at them. When they were about to flee away, he said to them: If&nbsp;<br>
you are my real friends, you would have kept patience at my difficulty. (10) A certain sage used to&nbsp;<br>
take out a writing from his pocket every hour and read it. Therein it was written: Be patient at the&nbsp;<br>
decree of your Lord as you are-in My careful sight - 52 : 48. (11) It is narrated that the wife of the&nbsp;<br>
saint Fateh Mussalli once slipped down and her joint was broker:.- She<br>
&quot;then gave thanks to God after rising up. She was asked: Have you got no pain? She said: The joy of the&nbsp;<br>
reward of pain removed from my heart the pangs of pain. (12) Hazrat Daud said to his son Solaiman: Fear&nbsp;<br>
of God in a believer is proved by three things. (1) He relies on God for what he cannot earn. (2) he&nbsp;<br>
remains satisfied with God for what he earns and (3)-he keeps patience for what<br>
goes away from him. (13) Our Prophet said: Not to complain of your wants and sufferings and not to tell&nbsp;<br>
anybody of your dangers appertain to the glorification of God and spiritual knowledge. (14) A certain&nbsp;<br>
pious man said that he had lost a purse on the way owing to the action of a pick-pocket. He said, 0&nbsp;<br>
God: Give him similar reward. Perchance he has got greater need of the purse than mine: (15) Another&nbsp;<br>
pious man said: Once during my journey, I saw Abu Huzaifa fallen on the ground wounded in the battle&nbsp;<br>
field of Mawla Salem and asked him: Shall I give you water? He said: Take me near the foes and put&nbsp;<br>
water on my shield as I am fasting. If I live up to sun set I will break my fast therewith. Such was&nbsp;<br>
the patience of those. who sought the next world. (16) It has been reported from Ramisah Omme Salim&nbsp;<br>
that she said: One of my sons died during the absence of his father. I kept him covered with one sheet&nbsp;<br>
of cloth in a corner of the house.<br>
A little after my ffter my	'-<br>
husband va~iu came. I ~ presented before him food. He ate it and asked me: How is my son? I said that&nbsp;<br>
he is a little better by the will of God than he was before. I lay with my husband in that night being&nbsp;<br>
well dressed. Then I said: Will you not be astonished at my neighbour? He asked me: What has become of&nbsp;<br>
him? I told him: I lent him a good thing. When I demanded it of him, he threatened me and began to weep&nbsp;<br>
out of sorrow. He said: What he did is manifestly wrong. I said: This is your son. I took him as a loan&nbsp;<br>
from God but He took him close to Him. He recited: We are for God and to Him we shall return. Next&nbsp;<br>
morning he went to the Prophet and gave him this news. He said: 0 God, make their last night good. (19)&nbsp;<br>
At the time when Ibrahim, son of the Prophet died, the Prophet began to shed tears. He was asked; Why&nbsp;<br>
do you weep when you have prohibited us from it? He said: It is through affection. He who is kind gets&nbsp;<br>
kindness from God. This weeping did not out me from the state of contentment.<br>
<br>
From what has been discussed above, it has been clear to you that in all circumstances and actions of&nbsp;<br>
life, patience is absolutely necessary. If one keeps patience, still hundreds of empty thoughts may&nbsp;<br>
arise in his mind and keep him forgetful of God. Thus he is not free from the whisperings of the devil&nbsp;<br>
and mind is. not free from thoughts-thoughts of past and future causing loss of valuable time. The&nbsp;<br>
weapon of a man is his Qalb or heart and his life is his valuable asset. When a moment is lost without&nbsp;<br>
remembrance of God, it is spent uselessly.<br>
72	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
DEVIL'S TWO ARMIES: The devil has got two company of armies. One company lover over the sky and another&nbsp;<br>
over land. The movements of the company which lover over the sky are called passions. This is because&nbsp;<br>
the devil was created of fire and man of dried clay. Dried clay means clay burnt by fire. The nature of&nbsp;<br>
fire is to rise upwards and of earth to go down. When the devil was ordered to make prostration before&nbsp;<br>
man, he was thereby ordered to remove the pride and passions of upward tendency and to be subservient&nbsp;<br>
to man but he declined and disobeyed God. The life of prostration is humility and its body is placing&nbsp;<br>
of forehead on the ground. It means to crush all sorts of vanity and pride. So you should shift the&nbsp;<br>
jewel from its outward cover, life from its body and the seed from its outer form and guide your life&nbsp;<br>
accordingly. This open world is the outer cover and the next work is its inner seed. If you take up the&nbsp;<br>
outer world and neglect<br>
tr	t 	d,7 	:I1 1... a..l.:	tL,	t	:tl	a tl.._ tIl AMAt VVUl111, yuu YYlll uC&nbsp;<br>

inner seed. You should understand that the devil has been given time up to the Resurrection Day and he&nbsp;<br>
will not stop to whisper evils. If your object of thought be one and the same (God), the devil will not&nbsp;<br>
find place of refuge in your heart. When you become sincerely devoted to God, the supremacy of the&nbsp;<br>
devil will vanish. The devil runs in your vains like the blowing of wind in a cup. It will be&nbsp;<br>
impossible to keep the cup empty either of water or of air. So also the case with mind. It is engaged&nbsp;<br>
always with religious thoughts and actions, it becomes free from the influence of devil, or devilish&nbsp;<br>
tendencies. For this reason,, God says: I appoint a devil for one who remains aloof from&nbsp;<br>
God-remembrance and he becomes then his companion. The Holy Prophet said: God is dissatisfied with a&nbsp;<br>
young man having an empty mind. When Manusr Hallaj was raised upon the gallows, he was asked: What is&nbsp;<br>
Sufism? He replied: It is your soul. If you engage it, it will keep you engaged. So the meaning of&nbsp;<br>
patience is to keep away from every destructive and inurious thing.<br>
MEANS OF RAISING STRENGTH OF PATIENCE: Know, 0 readers, that every disease has got a medicine. Though&nbsp;<br>
patience is troublesome, yet it is possible to acquire it by the medicine which is a mixture of&nbsp;<br>
knowledge and action. When patience has got different classes, its diseases also are different. The&nbsp;<br>
medicine of a disease is its opposite thing. We shall explain it by a few examples. Take the case of&nbsp;<br>
sexual passion. When it<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	73<br>
becomes strong, when it cannot be kept under control, when sight cannot be kept under control and when&nbsp;<br>
mind cannot be kept under control, different medicines shall have to be taken. In order to remove them&nbsp;<br>
from mind, it shall have to be kept engaged in Zikr, Fikr and good deeds. There are three modes. (1)&nbsp;<br>
Firstly, if it rises out of delicious and excessive food, it should be brought under control by fasting&nbsp;<br>
and by breaking it with little food without meat and other exciting foods. (2) Secondly, the basic&nbsp;<br>
causes shall have to be cut off, namely sight of eye, as it enkindles passion in mind. The remedy is to&nbsp;<br>
live in loneliness and to be careful in seeing beautiful things. The Holy Prophet said: Sight is a&nbsp;<br>
poisonous arrow out of the arrows of the devil. The devil throws it with such force that no shield can&nbsp;<br>
protect it. The sure remedy is to flee away from it or to shut up the eyes. (3) To satisfy passion in a&nbsp;<br>
lawful manner by marriage. This is most useful in<br>
case or many persons. the Prophet said: You should marry, if<br>
you are unable, keep fast which cuts the sexual passion. These are the three modes for giving up food&nbsp;<br>
to cut' off the basic causes of passion.<br>
1<br>
MODES OF INCREASING RELIGIOUS IMPULSE: There are two modes to make strong religious impulses.&nbsp;<br>
&quot;;Firstly, to give to the mind the sweet taste of rewards and<br>
merits of temporal and spiritual matters as result of efforts against passion and to think of the&nbsp;<br>
traditi¢ns that promised temporal and spiritual rewards of patience..The merits that are gained in&nbsp;<br>
having patience in dangers and difficulties cannot be gained otherwise. This should be realised in&nbsp;<br>
full. Mind should be given the lesson that satisfaction of carnal desires is short lived but one can&nbsp;<br>
gain everlasting supremacy by patience in dangers and difficulties, that dangers and difficulties are&nbsp;<br>
short and remain during life time but their rewards will r train for ever. This sure belief is termed&nbsp;<br>
Eqin or certain faith and this in turn produces firm determination for patience.<br>
2. Secondly, to make religious, feeling habituated to fight passions so that it may have pleasure of&nbsp;<br>
victory. In this way, religious impulse is made strong. For this reason the strength of the peasants&nbsp;<br>
and soldiers increases as they acquire it by habits. The second medicine is that one should be&nbsp;<br>
habituated from childhood to fight against low desires and passions, as a boy, if trained in physical&nbsp;<br>
exercises from boyhood becomes an athlete. If<br>
it<br>
74<br>
a man gives up fight with passion completely, he becomes weak in religious exercises and becomes unable&nbsp;<br>
to control his passions and low desires. This is the medicine in all kinds of patience. One is kept&nbsp;<br>
busy in the preparation of procuring food, dress and other necessities of livelihood. But if he can&nbsp;<br>
free his mind from these things, he can save himself and the secrets of heaven and earth are disclosed&nbsp;<br>
to him. Many a time a good game is earned with little efforts and many a time it cannot be gained with&nbsp;<br>
excessive efforts. This depends entirely on the mercy of God and man has got no hand in the matter. But&nbsp;<br>
it is true that it is under the control of man to be fit to earn that mercy of God by cutting of all&nbsp;<br>
worldly connections. The worldly things attract a man downwards and not upwards to heaven. So the thing&nbsp;<br>
which attracts downwards shall have to be cut off.<br>
<br>
'The Prophet said: There is breath of your Lord in the days of your life, why don't you face it? There&nbsp;<br>
are heavenly causes of the attraction to that breath, as God says: There is provision for you in heaven&nbsp;<br>
and what has been promised to you.&quot; This is an affair of highest order which is not known to us, but we&nbsp;<br>
should prepare ourselves to receive that thing. This is like the man who cultivates his field well,&nbsp;<br>
plucks out the weeds therefrom and thereafter grows seeds therein. These efforts become fruitless if&nbsp;<br>
God does not send rain. The work is sufficient for a peasant if he cultivates the field well, plucks&nbsp;<br>
out the injurious things therefrom and grows good seeds therein. So a servant must cultivate his mind&nbsp;<br>
well, make it fit for growing seeds of faith and sincerity and then wait for the mercy of God because&nbsp;<br>
no year or month passes without the descent of the mercy of God. As rain is expected in the rainy&nbsp;<br>
season, so descent of God's mercy is mostly expected in opportune moments and times like the day of&nbsp;<br>
Araft, jumma day, the night of blessing, the night of Qadr in Ramzan, the month of Ramzan, the time&nbsp;<br>
when sorrows and sufferings or illness comes, the time when people pray in congregation. As there is&nbsp;<br>
rain after prayer for rain, so also the rains of the mercy of God from the hidden treasures of God and&nbsp;<br>
the rain of Kashf come down. As the vapours rising from mountains and seas from cloud and shower rain,&nbsp;<br>
so also feelings come out of soul and shower blessings. But you are far away from this rain as your&nbsp;<br>
mind is best with passions and low desires. If these are not removed, the illumination of Ma'arfat or&nbsp;<br>
spiritual knowledge will not come out from the recess of heart. It is easier to bring<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	75<br>
water after digging the bottom of a well than to take it by digging lanes up to.&#149;this well. Likewise&nbsp;<br>
the water of mercy that lies hidden in the innermost recess of the heart and which lies covered with&nbsp;<br>
refuges like worldly passions must be blown by removing those passions.<br>
The great saint Junaid said: It is easy to take journey towards the next world from the world for a&nbsp;<br>
believer, but it is difficult to renounce the company of men in order to gain divine love, to take&nbsp;<br>
journey towards God. from passions and low desires is very difficult, but it is much more difficult to&nbsp;<br>
have patience after living with God. The temptation of having name and fame is very great. Then why&nbsp;<br>
will it not be a greater object of test to have Rabubiat or to have the pleasure of the attributes of&nbsp;<br>
God in one's life?<br>
God says: Say, soul is an order of God - 1~ : '<br>
order of ~~u 7 &#149; iJQ. So to love<br>
God is an attribute of soul. If it does not love Him, it is the effect of the machination of the devil.&nbsp;<br>
As soul is a divine thing, the devil tries to misguide it. This soul searches after everlasting things,&nbsp;<br>
such things which never come to an end. It seeks such honour as has got no disgrace, such safety as has&nbsp;<br>
got no fear, such wealth as has got no want, such perfection as has got no decrease. These are the&nbsp;<br>
attributes of God which should be searched by all men. He who searches them attains perfection and&nbsp;<br>
honour. For this reason, the Prophet said: Fool is he who follows his passion and dares against God.&nbsp;<br>
God mentioned about the disgraceful men in this verse: Never, you love the world and give up the&nbsp;<br>
Hereafter. God says: Turn your faces from those who turn away from My remembrance and who do not like&nbsp;<br>
except this world's life. God sent down Prophets to reclaim lost humanity and to turn their minds&nbsp;<br>
towards the next world. God says: 0 believers, when you are advised to walk swiftly in the path of God,&nbsp;<br>
what has become of you that you keep,attached to the world? Are you satisfied with this world in&nbsp;<br>
preference to the next world? The enjoyment of this world is nothing but insignificant in comparison&nbsp;<br>
with that of the next world.<br>
A certain king asked a saint: Have you got any need? He replied: How can I seek my need from you when&nbsp;<br>
my sovereignty is greater than yours. The king asked him: How is that? He replied: He who is your&nbsp;<br>
master is my slave. The king asked him: How is that? He replied: You are the slave of greed, anger,<br>
PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
76<br>
passions and belly, but I have overcome them all. So they are my, slaves.<br>
The modes of one engrossed in name and fame (1) He shall flee away from his place of name and fame. God&nbsp;<br>
says: Is not the world of God wide enough for the purpose of emigration? (2) He shall keep himself in&nbsp;<br>
actions opposed to his habits as a thing can be removed by its opposite thing, such as cold by heat.&nbsp;<br>
(3) He shall do these things carefully and gradually as nature can not be changed all of a sudden.&nbsp;<br>
Habits should be changed one by one as the Prophet said: Don't take the religion as a rigour, as he who&nbsp;<br>
thinks it as a rigour, it will overcome him. So habit is the second nature. A boy at first should be&nbsp;<br>
compelled to learn reading and writing. When he is habituated to it, he takes pleasure in education. A&nbsp;<br>
certain pious man asked the saint Shibli about patience - which patience is difficult? He replied:&nbsp;<br>
Patience about God. The pious man said: I don't ask you about it. Shibli said: Tell me then which&nbsp;<br>
patience is most difficult? The pious man said: Patience from God is most difficult. The saint Shibli&nbsp;<br>
then raised up such a loud shriek that he was about to expire. God says: Be patient, vie in patience&nbsp;<br>
with one another and have perseverance therein. In other words, have patience about God and stick to&nbsp;<br>
Him. A certain pious man said: There is wealth in having patience for God and there is )ermanency in&nbsp;<br>
having patience about God and there is fulfillment of promise in having patience with God and there is&nbsp;<br>
dryness in having patience from God.<br>

MERITS OF GRATEFULNESS<br>
Quranic verses: Know, 0 dear readers, that God conjoined gratefulness with Zikr and said: Zikr&nbsp;<br>
(remembrance) of God is most great. He says: Remember Me. I will remember you. Be grateful to me and be&nbsp;<br>
not ungrateful. He says: If you be grateful and have faith, what will He do in giving you punishment?&nbsp;<br>
He says: I will soon reward the grateful - 3:144Q. God says of the devil: The devil said: I will surely&nbsp;<br>
sit on the straight path for them. It has been said that the meaning of straight path is gratefulness.&nbsp;<br>
The devil said: You will not find most of them grateful - 7 : 17Q. God says: There are a few grateful&nbsp;<br>
people among My servants - 34:14Q. God says: If you are grateful, I will surely grant you more - 14 :&nbsp;<br>
7Q. The subjects of this increase are<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	77<br>
five-wealth, grant of invocation, provision, forgiveness and repentance. The Quran says about each&nbsp;<br>
subject in the following verses. About wealth: If God wills, He will make you free from want out of His&nbsp;<br>
grace. About grant of invocation: He can give you what you pray for if He wills. About provision: He&nbsp;<br>
gives provisions to whom He wills without account. About forgiveness of sin: He forgives what is&nbsp;<br>
besides that one whom He pleases. About repentance: He accepts repentance from one whom. He pleases.&nbsp;<br>
These are the attributes of God as He says: He accepts gratefulness and is patient.<br>
Hadis: The Prophet said: He who expresses gratefulness after taking food shall have rank equal to the&nbsp;<br>
rank of one who fasts with patience. Hazrat Ayesha said: All the actions of the Prophet are wonderful.&nbsp;<br>
One night the Prophet slept in my bed, so<br>
much so that my body	1 n<br>
ody touched CU his. ~ T hen e said: 0 daughter of Abu Bakr, leave me, will you worship my Lord? Hazrat&nbsp;<br>
Ayesha said: I wish to spend some time in your company, but I like what you wish. Then the Prophet made&nbsp;<br>
ablutibn an stood up for prayer. He wept so much in prayer that his tears flowed down his breast. Bilal&nbsp;<br>
came and asked him: 0 Prophet of God why do you weep while your past and future sins have been&nbsp;<br>
forgiven? The Prophet said: Shall I not be a grateful servant? Then the following verse was revealed:&nbsp;<br>
In the creation of heavens and earth and in the changing of night and day, there are surely clear signs&nbsp;<br>
for those who are intelligent-3 :190Q.<br>
So it appears that weeping should never be stopped. This is understood from the following anectode. A&nbsp;<br>
certain Prophet was passing by a small stone which was then gushing forth abundant water. He was&nbsp;<br>
greatly astonished. Then God gave it the power of speech and it began to say: Since I heard the&nbsp;<br>
following verse of God &quot;The fuel of Hell will be men and stones (2 :24Q).' I have been weeping being&nbsp;<br>
afraid of it.&quot; The Prophet then prayed to God for saving it from Hell and the prayer was granted. After&nbsp;<br>
some days, the Prophet saw it in previous condition and asked: Why do you weep now? The stone said: I&nbsp;<br>
wept before out of fear, but now I weep out of joy and gratefulness.<br>
The mind of man is hard like stone, rather harder than stone and the hardness is removed by a state&nbsp;<br>
arising out of fear and gratefulness. The Prophet said: It will be proclaimed on the Resurrection Day:&nbsp;<br>
Rise up those who proclaimed the glory of<br>
PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
78	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
God. Then a party will rise up with banners and they will enter paradise. He was asked: Who are the&nbsp;<br>
proclaimers of glory? He said: Those who express gratefulness to God in happiness and adversity. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet also said: Praise is the sheet of the Merciful. God revealed to Jacob: I am pleased with My&nbsp;<br>
friend for his gratefulness. God then revealed to him describing the qualities of the patient. &quot;Their&nbsp;<br>
abode is the abode of peace. They will enter therein. They will be busy in gratefulness.&quot; That is the&nbsp;<br>
good speech. They will pray more at the time of gratefulness. Then I will grant them My vision.&quot; When&nbsp;<br>
the following verse was revealed about hidden treasure &quot;Those who hoard up gold and silver and do not&nbsp;<br>
spend them in the way of God give them-news of severe chastisement (9 : 35Q).&quot; Hazrat Omar asked the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet: What wealth shall we keep? The Prophet said: A remembering tongue, a grateful heart and a&nbsp;<br>
believing wife.<br>
<br>
SPIRIT OF GRATEFULNESS: Know, 0 dear readers, that gratefulness is one of the good stages for those who&nbsp;<br>
travel-in the path of religion. There are steps of gratefulness-knowledge, condition and action.&nbsp;<br>
Knowledge is the root out of which condition takes birth and out of condition action arises. Knowledge&nbsp;<br>
consists in the fact that fortune comes from the Fortune-giver. The happiness that occurs out of&nbsp;<br>
getting that fortune is called condition or state of mind. To stand upon love and the objects of&nbsp;<br>
fortune- giver is called action which keeps connection with mind, tongue and limbs of body.<br>
<br>
WHAT IS KNOWLEDGE OF GRATEFULNESS? To know it, three things shall have to be known first - (1) source&nbsp;<br>
of gratefulness. (2) cause of given fortune (3) and the attributes of the fortune giver. Fortune,&nbsp;<br>
fortune-giver and fortune-taker to know these three things are necessary. This knowledge follows the&nbsp;<br>
knowledge of Tauhid and Taqdir. It means that one should have knowledge that whatever is in the&nbsp;<br>
universe comes from God and His gifts. If there is perfection of this knowledge there can not be Shirk&nbsp;<br>
or setting up partnership with God. If any gift comes from the king and if any body feels that there is&nbsp;<br>
kindness of his minister therein, it is setting up'partnership in the gift and thus enjoyment will be&nbsp;<br>
divided. Although the gift comes through his minister and in black and white, he or the paper and the&nbsp;<br>
ink are not entitled to have gratefulness as they are only mediums and not the source of the gift. They&nbsp;<br>
have no power and are guided<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	79<br>
by the king. Likewise, he who knows God and-His wonderful creation knows fully well that all the things&nbsp;<br>
in the world - the sun, the moon, the stars and all other things are. His creation and guided by Him as&nbsp;<br>
the pen is guided&quot; by a writer. Those animals which have got willl are-subservient to His will although&nbsp;<br>
He has given them freedom of will. They are like the man in charge of the treasures of the king. The&nbsp;<br>
man has got no power to wish against<br>
-the will of the king and cannot spend a farthing therefrom without the will of the king. So the man&nbsp;<br>
who takes the gift from God to you is bound to take it to you as God enkindles in him a strong desire&nbsp;<br>
to make a gift to you. God also enkindles in him a will to gift it along with a feeling that it will do&nbsp;<br>
him good both in this world and in the next and that the gift of a farthing here will be met with&nbsp;<br>
innumerable rewards in the hereafter just as a seed sprins forth a hundred seeds. This gift of charity&nbsp;<br>
is not to the poor man but rather it is to your self as you will get good rewards_ in lieu of your&nbsp;<br>
charity. In this way, you will recognise. God and get acquainted with His works. So God is to be&nbsp;<br>
praised and entitled to get gratefulness.<br>
One day, the Prophet Moses said in his invocation: 0 God you have created Adam. How has he expressed&nbsp;<br>
gratefulness to you? God said: He knew that everything came from Me. This knowledge is his&nbsp;<br>
gratefulness. So instead of beinggrateful to the giver, be grateful to Him who created the giver and&nbsp;<br>
his will.<br>
<br>
(2) State of mind on gratefulness: Know, readers, that the mind assumes a state when knowledge of&nbsp;<br>
gratefulness comes to it. The happiness which arises in mind out of gratefulness is called its state&nbsp;<br>
the feeling of gratefulness and humility for the donee. This state of mind in gratefulness is of three&nbsp;<br>
kinds. Take an illustration. When a king wants to go out and gives a horse to a certain man, the latter&nbsp;<br>
feels joy for three causes - (1) for getting a horse which will be useful to him, (2) for getting it&nbsp;<br>
from the head of state, (3) and for enjoyment of getting by riding on it, These are the three stages of&nbsp;<br>
gratefulness. In the first stage, the attention of the donee remains confined to the horse only and not&nbsp;<br>
to its giver. In the second stage, he expresses gratefulness to the giver. In the third stage,&nbsp;<br>
gratefulness gains perfection as he expresses it to God who enkindled a will in the king to gift the&nbsp;<br>
horse to him. This is the highest stage. The saint Shibli said: To turn attention to the giver rather&nbsp;<br>
than to the gift is gratefulness. The saint Khaoas said:<br>
80<br>
PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	81<br>
People in general express gratefulness on getting food, dress and drink but the really wise men do it&nbsp;<br>
in getting beneficial things to soul. He who gets enjoyment in getting only the things enjoyable to&nbsp;<br>
eye, ear, belly and sexual organ, cannot express real gratefulness as there is disease in his soul.&nbsp;<br>
Real happiness consists in the happiness of soul by remembering God. A diseased man may get pleasure in&nbsp;<br>
eating earth or displeasure in sweets.<br>
(3) To get acquainted with actions arising out of gratefulness. It is to act with happiness by getting&nbsp;<br>
acquainted with the giver of gift. This action is connected with mind, tongue and all bodily limbs.&nbsp;<br>
These are the three modes of expressing gratefulness. To express gratefulness by mind is to pray for&nbsp;<br>
good of all people and to cherish such a will. To express gratefulness by tongue is to praise God under&nbsp;<br>
all circumstances; and to express it by the bodily limbs means to employ them in the service of the&nbsp;<br>
Lord and to save them from committing sins prohibited by Him.<br>
The Prophet once asked a man: How are you? He replied: I am well. The Prophet asked him the same&nbsp;<br>
question and he replied the same with addition: I praise God and I am grateful to Him. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said: I wanted to have this reply from you. The pious man of yore asked the same question to have the&nbsp;<br>
third reply. Whenever a person is asked about his condition, he either expresses gratefulness or tells&nbsp;<br>
him his sorrows and difficulties or remains silent. In case of gratefulness there are rewards, in case&nbsp;<br>
of sorrows and difficulties, there are sins on the part of the pious. Why will it not be sin when&nbsp;<br>
complaint is made against God's actions? When a man cannot remain patient in dangers and difficulties,&nbsp;<br>
let him tell it to God as He only gives troubles and removes them. God says: Those who are worshipped&nbsp;<br>
besides God are not the master of your provisions. So seek provision from God, worship Him and be&nbsp;<br>
grateful to Him. God says: Those whom you worship besides God are servants like you.<br>
MODES OF GRATEFULNESS IN DUTIES TOWARDS GOD: There are two causes for which gratefulness to God is not&nbsp;<br>
similar to gratefulness to men. The first cause is that God is above all wants, while men are in wants.&nbsp;<br>
God is free from name, fame, prayers and prostrations. The second cause is that man has got freedom of&nbsp;<br>
will by which he does everything and that freedom is a gift from God. The Prophet Moses said: 0 Lord,&nbsp;<br>
how can'I<br>
express gratefulness to Thee when I am unable to express it<br>
without another gift? To be able to express gratefulness to Thee is another gift from Thee to me. That&nbsp;<br>
gift compels me to express gratefulness to Thee. There is another Hadis: When you understand that gi;t&nbsp;<br>
comes from Me. I am pleased with that gratefulness. Take an illustration - A certain king sent to his&nbsp;<br>
servant one conveyance, one dress and some cash money with this object that he would come to him from a&nbsp;<br>
distance using all these things. Two conditions arise out of these gifts. The first condition is that&nbsp;<br>
if he comes to the king, he may engage him in some important work. The second' condition is that if he&nbsp;<br>
comes to him, his service may not be necessary and his glory will not be increased or decreased by his&nbsp;<br>
presence but it will do him benefit and not the king. The first condition does not apply to God as He&nbsp;<br>
is above all wants, but the second condition applies to Him. In other words, the gifts of God i f&nbsp;<br>
tutilised in proper manner will do him benefit and not God. A servant may be grateful or ungrateful. If&nbsp;<br>
he comes to the king by utilising his gifts, he will be grateful and if he does not care them and&nbsp;<br>
misuses his gifts, he will be ungrateful. Similarly if he utilises the gifts of God according to the&nbsp;<br>
ways prescribed by Him, it shall be expressing gratefulness to Him, but if he acts to the contrary, it&nbsp;<br>
will be expressing ungratefulness to Him. God says: (95: 6Q). I have created man in the best mould.&nbsp;<br>
Then I threw him to the lowest abyss except those who believe and do good. For them there is great&nbsp;<br>
reward never to be cut off.&quot; By this help of the gifts of God, man can rise to the highest pinnacle of&nbsp;<br>
glory and if not utilised he may go down to the lowest abyss. Proper use, misues or absence of use will&nbsp;<br>
not affect God in the least, but they are linked with fortune and misfortune of man. To use God's gifts&nbsp;<br>
according to His will and directions is gratefulness.<br>
<br>
ACTIONS DEAR AND NOT DEAR TO GOD: Know, 0 dear readers that gratefulness does not become perfect if we&nbsp;<br>
do not know the distinction between actions loved by God and actions not loved by God, because&nbsp;<br>
gratefulness means to spend His gifts in acts loved by God and ungratefulness means to spend them in&nbsp;<br>
acts not loved by Him or keep them without use. There are two subtle things for this distinction-(1) to&nbsp;<br>
hear the verses of the Quran and tradition of the Prophet and (2) to see with the eye of thought or&nbsp;<br>
knowledge. For this reason. God sent the apostles who showed them His ways. So these ways are the&nbsp;<br>
foundations<br>

of good actions. Those who do not tread these ways do not<br>
express gratefulness. There is wisdom in the creation of everything in the world. That wisdom is of two&nbsp;<br>
classes-open and secret. The open wisdom is learning or knowledge. Wisdom of God in creating the sun is&nbsp;<br>
that thereby we can understand the distinetion between day and night, that day time is for procuring&nbsp;<br>
provisions and night time is for rest. There are other subtle causes. The Quran described the open&nbsp;<br>
causes but we can understand the secret subtle causes by knowledge. God says : I send profuse rain,&nbsp;<br>
then split-up the earth and grow therein crops and grapes- 80 : 25Q. God says : I have adorned the sky&nbsp;<br>
of the world with adornment of stars-37:6Q. So there are hundreds of purposes in the creation of these&nbsp;<br>
and other things. We see that God created eye to see and not to hear, ear to hear and not to see, hands&nbsp;<br>
to catch and not to walk, legs to walk and not to catch, nose to smell and not to hear. There are&nbsp;<br>
secret limbs, such as stomach, heart, spleen, livers, sinews and other things. Each limb has been&nbsp;<br>
assigned a special function to perform. Some limb helps digestion, some purifies blood, some circulates&nbsp;<br>
blood, some creates urine. Those who have been given special knowledge of the functions of each limb&nbsp;<br>
cannot be compared with that of God. So if a man does not utilize a thing for which it is created&nbsp;<br>
becomes ungrateful to God for the gift. He who unjustly beats another with his hand expresses&nbsp;<br>
ungratefulness for the gift of hands as hands have been created for removing the injurious things to&nbsp;<br>
soul and receive the beneficial things, but not to destroy a thing or beat or assul t a person. The man&nbsp;<br>
who looks to a strange woman with lust expresses ungreatfulness for the gift of eyes. By the above act.&nbsp;<br>
he does a thing against the will of God. His will is that by His help and by the help of the created&nbsp;<br>
things, he will meet with God. So one cannot meet with. Him till he loves Him. He will not get His love&nbsp;<br>
.ill he remembers Him always. This remembrance does not becom possible without a body and the body does&nbsp;<br>
not go alright if it is not given food and the food is not possible without earth, water and air. These&nbsp;<br>
things are not possible without earth and sky and without the open and secret limbs. So all these&nbsp;<br>
things have been created for body and body is the outer cover of soul and a satisfied soul will reach&nbsp;<br>
God by virtue of long divine service. For this reason, God said : I have created man and jinn that they&nbsp;<br>
may serve Me and I don't expect povision from them-50:156Q.<br>
GOD'S PLAN IN CREATION OF GOLD AND SILVER<br>
God and silver are two gifts of God and by their help all the worldly acts are smoothly done. These are&nbsp;<br>
nothing but stones and have got no value of their own. People want to have them as by their exchange&nbsp;<br>
commodities of the world can be purchased. There are several thing which he cannot gather and several&nbsp;<br>
things for which he has got no necessity. For example, a man has got food, but has got no riding camel.&nbsp;<br>
He who has got a camel has got necessity of food. So between them there is the necessity of exchange of&nbsp;<br>
these two things and fixation of their value. But value of these things are not equal. Therefore gold&nbsp;<br>
and silver work as judges for all things for fixation of value and for getting the things through their&nbsp;<br>
medium. Then it is said that a camel's price is one hundred dinars and that the price of 100 fowls is&nbsp;<br>
the same. So by the help of gold and silver their values are adjusted, although they have got no value&nbsp;<br>
of their own. God appointed them as judges for ascertainment of values and prices of all things and for&nbsp;<br>
their exchange. For this reason, these gold and silver are dear to men. He who has got gold and silver&nbsp;<br>
possesses as it it were all things. A mirror has got no value of its own, but its value lies in the&nbsp;<br>
fact that it assumes picture of all things. Similar is the case with gold and silver. as by their&nbsp;<br>
exchange all necessary things can be purchased. There are other plans, just as a word has got no&nbsp;<br>
meaning unless it is conjoined with other words.<br>
Misuse of gold and silver. He who by these gold and silver does such an act which is opposed to the&nbsp;<br>
above plan of God, commits sin and is ungrateful to the gift of God. If instead of using them one&nbsp;<br>
buries them underground or hoards them for long, he does opperssion to them and make inoperative the&nbsp;<br>
object of God. These gold and silver have not been created specially for Zaid or Amir but as medium for&nbsp;<br>
exchange of things. They are however not been created for food but for getting food. There is writing&nbsp;<br>
of God on everything without words. God says (in 9 : 34Q)-Those who hoard up gold and silver and do not&nbsp;<br>
spend in the way of God give them news of grievous punishment.<br>
Gold and silver used as utensils. If anybody uses gold and silver for utensils, reservoirs and cups or&nbsp;<br>
for anything else like these, acts contrary to the object for which these are created and is ungrateful&nbsp;<br>
to God and he commits sins. His condition is worse than that of the man who keeps them buried, Cups can&nbsp;<br>
be made<br>
6<br>
84	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
of iron or copper but they have no value of exchange and all things cannot be purchased through their&nbsp;<br>
medium. For this purpose gold and silver have been created. For this reason, the Prophet said: He who&nbsp;<br>
drinks in cup of gold and silver, enkindles as it were the fire of Hell in his belly.<br>
<br>
Gold and silver used as bargain of interest : He who opens the business of purchase and sale of gold&nbsp;<br>
and silver in order to earn profit or in other words to take usury and interest, will be working&nbsp;<br>
against the plan and object of God and therefore will commit sin. He is ungrateful to the gift of God&nbsp;<br>
as these two things have not been created for purchase and sale but as mediums to get necessary things.&nbsp;<br>
When there is business of the same kind of things, there is action against the will of God. The plan of&nbsp;<br>
these two thing in like the place of a word in a sentence or the place of a<br>
mirror in colours. So ex.ha^exchange of gold u and a i silver r four r<br>
w f goigold and<br>
silver has got no meaning. If the object be hoarding, it will be an act of opperssion.<br>
Question: Why is it that gold can be purchased legally in exchange of silver?<br>
Answer : The object of gold is separate from that of silver, as a piece of gold can be exchanged for&nbsp;<br>
several pieces of silver, just as, a rupee can be exchanged for one hundred paisa by which many small&nbsp;<br>
things can be purchased. If it is prohibited, things cannot be easily purchased or sold. One rupee can&nbsp;<br>
be exchanged for another rupee as nobody will be willing to do that without profit. but one rupee&nbsp;<br>
cannot be exchanged for more than one rupee. The use of counterfeit coins is not lawful as an owner of&nbsp;<br>
good coins will not be ready to receive counterfeit coins, even though the number of the latter is&nbsp;<br>
greater. Barter system is not also lawful as the good and bad of it are the same.<br>
Hoarding of food-stuffs is bad as they have been created for the upkeep of the body. If there is&nbsp;<br>
hoarding business of these things for long the object for which food stuffs have been created is&nbsp;<br>
frustrated. He who has got surplus food-stuff should transfer it to those who have got necessity for&nbsp;<br>
them. He who wants food-stuff in exchange of the same kind of food-stuff cannot legally get it as he&nbsp;<br>
has got no need of it. For this reason, Shariat cursed those who hoard up food stuff.<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	85<br>
There are illustrations about the objects of the creation of gold, silver and food-stuff. So don't&nbsp;<br>
misuse anything for which it has been created. God says : He who has been given wisdom has been given&nbsp;<br>
abundant good-2: 269 Q. Those minds which are the store houses of temptations and playgrounds of the&nbsp;<br>
devil cannot grasp the root-cause of God's object in creating a thing. For this, the Prophet said : Had&nbsp;<br>
not the devil moved in the heart of man, they would have seen the sovereignty of God. When you have&nbsp;<br>
understood this thing, you can guess whether your movements and actions are grateful or ungrateful as&nbsp;<br>
there is nothing which is outside these two attributes.<br>
<br>
OWNERSHIP OF LAND: Only God is the permanent owner of lands, as everything in heaven and earth belongs&nbsp;<br>
to Him. So declares the Quran. How can a servant of God become the owner of a land when he cannot keep&nbsp;<br>
himself under his control but his master controls him? It is true that every man has got necessity for&nbsp;<br>
food and the earth is the dinning cloth of God. The people have been ordered to eat what is absolutely&nbsp;<br>
necessary for them from the foods served on this dining cloth out of the food-stuffs grown by God in&nbsp;<br>
the earth. The king has. spread dining cloth of food for his servants. If a servant takes a morsel of&nbsp;<br>
food out of it and if another snatches it away from him, it is not allowed. The reason is not that the&nbsp;<br>
former has become owner of the morsel as the hand which catches it and the person possessing the hand&nbsp;<br>
are both servants, but when he has got necessity of a morsel of food, he becomes possessor of it. This&nbsp;<br>
is justice. Its peculiarity is first possession. This is true in case of all servants of God. No&nbsp;<br>
servant has got any right to possess what is not necessary for his livelihood. So it is true that he&nbsp;<br>
who amasses and hoards wealth for long or hoards up food stuffs beyond his necessity is an oppressor&nbsp;<br>
and belongs to those persons who are condemned by God in the following verse : Those who hoard up gold&nbsp;<br>
and silver and do not spend in the way of God. Give them news of grievous chastisement. Way of God&nbsp;<br>
means performance of duties towards God which means spending wealth for the servants of God who are in&nbsp;<br>
need and wants. To hoard up food-stuff, in godowns after snatching them from the needy people is a&nbsp;<br>
heinous offence. After meeting one's own necessity, the surplus wealth should be distributed among the&nbsp;<br>
needy and the destitutes. To this effect, the Quran says : They ask you about spending. Tell what is in&nbsp;<br>
excess.<br>
86	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	87<br>
The above view is opposed to open Shariat or religious law now prevalent in the society, as it is&nbsp;<br>
difficult to asertain the limit of necessity. A certain amount of wealth may meet one's necessity but&nbsp;<br>
it does not meet the necessity of another. So necessity differs in different persons. Therefore it is&nbsp;<br>
said to be lawful for the common people to hoard up if Zakat is paid, but the Zakat giver is said to be&nbsp;<br>
miser according to the above view. So only payment of Zakat is not the limit of charity, as the Quran&nbsp;<br>
says : If He wants this from you and then compels you, you would be miser-47: 37 Q. The thing which has&nbsp;<br>
got no wrong is justice. It is also justice for a servant not to take beyond what is necessary for him&nbsp;<br>
in his walk of worldly pursuits from the wealth of the gifts of God. Every servant of God is a&nbsp;<br>
sojourner to reach the Almighty by using a conveyance. He who takes excessive load in his journey and&nbsp;<br>
does not give his fellow travellers what is necessary for them is an oppression. He gives up justice&nbsp;<br>
and works opposed to the plan and purpose of God and thus exposes ungratefulness for the gifts of God&nbsp;<br>
bestowed on him. It has been well established by the Quran, Hadis and good conscience that the thing in&nbsp;<br>
excess of the necessity of a traveller to God will come as a burden or punishment on him both in the&nbsp;<br>
world and in the next. So God says : There are very few among My servants who are grateful. The devil&nbsp;<br>
was pleased to hear this verse : You will not find most of them grateful. Those who do not understand&nbsp;<br>
the basic and subtle meaning of these verses do not understand their implications.<br>
<br>
Question: By this argument, it is understood that in everything there is an object and plan and man's&nbsp;<br>
action is either an instrument to fulfill that object or is opposed to it and that any action which&nbsp;<br>
leads to God's plan is gratefulness and any action which goes against it is ungratefulness. But these&nbsp;<br>
actions of men are in fact the actions of God as they cannot move without the will of God. When man&nbsp;<br>
have got no freedom of will apart from the will of God is there any meaning of their being grateful or&nbsp;<br>
ungrateful?<br>
<br>
Answer: The answer is buried in the deep ocean of spiritual knowledge. He who can understand the&nbsp;<br>
language of birds can understand it. There is an special attribute of God cut of which new creations&nbsp;<br>
come into being in the world. That is an attribute which cannot be seen by the eye of language and&nbsp;<br>
there is no such<br>
word as can explain that attribute of God. Intelligence is then lost just as a bat becomes blind before&nbsp;<br>
the scorching rays of the sun. It does not occur because of any defect in the sun but it does occur&nbsp;<br>
owing to the weakness of sight of the bat. Similarly those whose eye of knowledge has been opened for&nbsp;<br>
seeing the superb beauty of God, can appreciate it. They term it as extraordinary power. Man has been&nbsp;<br>
divided into two classes. The original decree is so powerful on one class that they are bound to do&nbsp;<br>
what has been decreed and extraordinary power is so great on another class that it carries them to the&nbsp;<br>
highest pinnacle of glory. That state of mind is called contentment. The condition of one who does not&nbsp;<br>
fulfill that object is called displeasure. A certain king removed the dirtiness of a slave and adorned&nbsp;<br>
him with fine and good dress and then said to the slave: How beautiful you are. How good is your dress.&nbsp;<br>
In fact the king is beautiful and for the beauty of the slave the king is to henraised_ By praising the&nbsp;<br>
slave he is praising himself.<br>
<br>
Similar is the case of actions in the record of fate. The causes are guided by God but not by the&nbsp;<br>
wishes of men. He is not to be asked why He does it, but the people will be asked for their actions.&nbsp;<br>
The Prophet said: When fate is mentioned, refrain from talking of it. To learn swimming is possible but&nbsp;<br>
he who walks upon water does not require training in swimming. The latter person can understand it. For&nbsp;<br>
this reason, the Prophet was asked: How could the Prophet Jesus walk over water? He 'replied: Had his&nbsp;<br>
sure faith increased more he could have walked through the air.<br>
<br>
Take an illustration. A certain king required the services of two men - one to give him drink of wine&nbsp;<br>
and another to act as sweeper in his house. The former is beautiful and good and the latter is ugly and&nbsp;<br>
bad. The sweeper can not say: To give drink of wine to the king is my duty. The king himself -did&nbsp;<br>
justice in enjoying the good man in superior work and the had man in inferior work. Similarly your&nbsp;<br>
knowledge, your strength, your power, your actions and movements are all His works and He divided the&nbsp;<br>
management in the best possible manner. Actions of man flow from them. But you see that you are free to&nbsp;<br>
do whatever you like and that the spiritual and unseen world has got no hand in the matter. If you&nbsp;<br>
entertain such idea in your mind, you become just like a boy who looks to the movement of toys and&nbsp;<br>
praises the toys for their movements. The man who makes the<br>
88<br>
PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	89<br>
toys move stays behind the screen outside the view of the boy who sees that the toys dance, stand and&nbsp;<br>
sit. The wise man understands that the toys are only plays of the real man behind the screen. Similar&nbsp;<br>
is the case with the people of the world who are like toys before the wise or before those who are&nbsp;<br>
beloved of God. They can see the thin thread that is conjoined to men of the work and that is not&nbsp;<br>
visible to the naked eye.<br>
Then the threads have been placed in the hands of their angels who move the heaven and the angels&nbsp;<br>
receive orders from the Almighty. God says: There is provision for you in the sky and what you have&nbsp;<br>
been given promise. God says: He created the seven heavens and the earth like them and He sends affairs&nbsp;<br>
between them that you may know that God is Powerful over all things and that His knowledge encompasses&nbsp;<br>
everything - 65: 12 Q. Hazrat Ibn Abbas says of the wise men among whom He sends down orders as&nbsp;<br>
mentioned on the above verse. He also said: If I disclose what I know of this verse, you will throw&nbsp;<br>
stones at me.<br>
Now the meaning of gratefulness is that it makes His plan perfected by the actions of men. He who is&nbsp;<br>
grateful to God by doing good works is dear to God. The angels are most dear to Him as there is order&nbsp;<br>
in them. Among them there is an angel named Israfil who is dearest to God and through whom God&nbsp;<br>
corrected the prophets. In this world, the prophets are dearest to God, through whom God showed the&nbsp;<br>
right path to men. Of all the Prophets, the Prophet Muhammad has been given the highest rank as through&nbsp;<br>
him Islam was made perfect and as he is the seal of the prophets. Next to the Prophets are the learned&nbsp;<br>
men who are the heirs of the Prophets as they are themselves pious and they showed the people the paths&nbsp;<br>
of piety and truth. Next is the rank of the just rulers as they keep themselves busy in doing good and&nbsp;<br>
justice to the people. Except those, all the people are shepherds.<br>
MODES OF EXPRESSING GRATEFULNESS: Gratefulness is expressed for gifts. It is impossible to recount the&nbsp;<br>
number of gifts of God on man. God says: If you count the gifts of God, you won't be able to count them&nbsp;<br>
-16 :18Q. We shall now describe the modes of expression of gratefulness.<br>
Know, 0 dear readers, that every good, taste, fortune or every desired thing is called gift but true&nbsp;<br>
gift is fortune in the next world and without this gift of other things is misnomer. The<br>
worldly gift which does not help the hereafter cannot be called gift.<br>
(1) First division of next worldly fortune. Though one, it has got several divisions. (1) What is&nbsp;<br>
beneficial both in this world and the next knowledge and good conduct. (2) What is injurious in both&nbsp;<br>
the worlds - ignorance and bad conduct. (3) What is beneficial in this world but injurious in the&nbsp;<br>
here-after-pleasure of temptation, (4) what is injurious in this world, but beneficial in the&nbsp;<br>
here-after-control of passions, temptations and opposition to vain desires. What is beneficial both in&nbsp;<br>
the world and the next is truly gift - knowledge and good conduct. What is injurious in both the worlds&nbsp;<br>
is misfortune. What is beneficial in this world but injurious in the hereafter is a danger to a man of&nbsp;<br>
insight but gift to a blind man. He is like a hungry man. He sees honey mixed with poison as a gift&nbsp;<br>
because he is ignorant. When he comes to know of poison he learns that he is being guided to a danger.&nbsp;<br>
What is injurious in this world but beneficial in the hereafter is a valuable gift to a wise man, but a&nbsp;<br>
danger to an ignorant man. it is just like that medicine which is distasteful but its result is good. A&nbsp;<br>
boy will think it a danger, but a wise man will take it as fortune. A father gives good education to&nbsp;<br>
his son though his mother often does not like it.<br>
(2) Second Division: The second division of getting next worldly fortune is as follows. The things of&nbsp;<br>
the world remain mixed with good and evil. What is necessary out of wealth, children, relatives, name&nbsp;<br>
and fame is beneficial but enormous wealth and world wide name and fame are not good. There are many&nbsp;<br>
pious men who get benefit from lawful wealth and there are people who have got little wealth which does&nbsp;<br>
him evil.<br>
(3) Third division: Some gifts are enjoyable in the world but are causes of sufferings in the next&nbsp;<br>
world. The next worldly fortune is divided into three classes. The first class of good things are&nbsp;<br>
generally dear as they are sought for themselves. The second class of good things are sought for other&nbsp;<br>
purposes and not for themselves such as gold and silver. They are loved as through their medium all&nbsp;<br>
things of enjoyments can be purchased. This is like his love for his king. In his love for his king, he&nbsp;<br>
loves his messenger, but he loves his messenger so much that even he forgets his love for the king.&nbsp;<br>
This is foolishness to the extreme. The third class of good things are such gifts which are sought for<br>
I<br>
90<br>
PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	91<br>
i<br>
themselves and for others, such as health and safety. The cause of these gifts is that by their help&nbsp;<br>
one can remember God.<br>
<br>
(4) Fourth division: The good works of the next worldly fortune are divided into three classes - (1)&nbsp;<br>
beneficial. (2) enjoyable and (3) beautiful. The things which are profitable in the next world is&nbsp;<br>
beneficial. The things which give enjoyment at present is enjoyable. The things which are good in all&nbsp;<br>
circumstances are beautiful. The injurious things are of 3 kinds - injurious, heinous and troublesome.<br>
<br>
(5) Fifth division: Every pleasure giving thing may be called a gift. There are three kinds of&nbsp;<br>
pleasures of men - (1) pleasure of knowledge, (2) bodily pleasure which is connected with some animals&nbsp;<br>
(3) and the pleasure which is connected with all animals. The pleasure that is gained by knowledge&nbsp;<br>
cannot be gained by the other organs of body except by soul. The pleasure of learning cannot be gained&nbsp;<br>
except by the learned Nature does not get fatigued with the acquisition of knowledge. The best benefit&nbsp;<br>
of learning is that it does not require any guard but wealth requires it. The more you spend learning,&nbsp;<br>
the more it increases, but the more you spend wealth the more it decreases. Learning guards you but you&nbsp;<br>
guard riches. Wealth may be stolen, but learning cannot be stolen. The learned live in peace but the&nbsp;<br>
rich live in fear: Learning is always beneficial but wealth sometimes leads to salvation and sometimes&nbsp;<br>
to destruction. For this reason, God in some places in the Quran termed wealth as Khair or good. Some&nbsp;<br>
people do not find pleasure in learning because they have got disease in their hearts. They are like&nbsp;<br>
the diseased man who does not get the taste of honey and considers it as bitter. Those who get no&nbsp;<br>
pleasure in learning and knowledge are divided into three classes - (1) those whose hearts have not&nbsp;<br>
increased like those of boys (2) those whose hearts have become dead by constantly following their&nbsp;<br>
passions and low desires. (3) those whose hearts are diseased for following their passions. God says:&nbsp;<br>
There are diseases in their hearts - 2: 10 Q. From this it appears that there is disease in intellect.&nbsp;<br>
God says: To warn those who are alive. Those whose hearts have been dead have been told of in this&nbsp;<br>
verse. He whose body is alive but heart is dead is dead to God, though he is alive to the ignorant&nbsp;<br>
people. For this reason, the martyrs are alive before their Lord and they are given provision. Though&nbsp;<br>
their bodies are dead they are alive.<br>
The second kind of pleasure of men lies in some matters such as supremacy, victory etc. The third kind&nbsp;<br>
of pleasure all animals enjoy in some matters - food, drink and sexual cohabitation. Most of the people&nbsp;<br>
consider these things as the most pleasure giving, but this pleasure is worst of all pleasures. The&nbsp;<br>
lower animals also feel these pleasures in these things just like men. This world means the physical&nbsp;<br>
world and the next world means the spiritual and unseen world. This material world follows the&nbsp;<br>
spiritual work as the picture in the mirror follows the picture of one who sees in the mirror. Though&nbsp;<br>
the picture in the mirror is the exact second picture, but it is the first picture from the point of&nbsp;<br>
view of your seeing as you have not seen your picture, and you have seen your picture first in the&nbsp;<br>
mirror and you can recognise it after you have seen it. The picture in the mirror stands as your&nbsp;<br>
prototype. So from the point of view of recognition, what remains behind comes forward and the thing&nbsp;<br>
which comes forward stays behind. Similarly the spiritual and unseen world is the second picture of&nbsp;<br>
this material world. There are such men who get pictures by receiving such admonition. If they see a&nbsp;<br>
thing of the spiritual world, that becomes the cause of their admonition. For this reason, God says: 0&nbsp;<br>
those having eyes, take admonition. There are also such man whose eye-sight is blind and who does not&nbsp;<br>
accept admonition and remains confined in this material world. Soon the door of Hell will be opened up&nbsp;<br>
for him and the fire will rise upon his heart. There is screen between his heart and the fire. When the&nbsp;<br>
screen will be lifted by the event of death, the fire will encompass him. Hell-fire is such a thing&nbsp;<br>
which can be felt by such thing as can be called knowledge of certainly or faith out of knowledge.&nbsp;<br>
Sometimes it can be seen by such thing which can be called certainty of eye or faith arising out of&nbsp;<br>
sight. The latter cannot be attained except in the next world, but the former can be felt in this&nbsp;<br>
world. The man who has been granted light of perfect faith gets such grace. For this reason, God says:&nbsp;<br>
Had you felt certainly arising out of knowledge, you would have certainly seen the fire of Hell (in&nbsp;<br>
this world)-102 :6.<br>
<br>
(6) Sixth Divison is the combination of all gifts. Know, 0 dear readers, that gifts are of two&nbsp;<br>
kinds-one kind is sought for its own sake and another kind is sought for the desired object. Next&nbsp;<br>
worldly bliss is the desired object. It has got four divisions - (1) everlasting bliss which has got no&nbsp;<br>
end, (2) everlasting bliss which has got no trouble, (3) perfect knowledge which has got no ignorance&nbsp;<br>
(4) and<br>
92	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
full pleasure which has got no want. These four things are called real gifts. For this reason, the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said:. There is no bliss except the bliss of the hereafter. This was uttered by the Prophet to&nbsp;<br>
console his companions when they were digging the trench at the battle of the Allies - He recited it at&nbsp;<br>
several other times also.<br>
FOUR ITEMS OF FULL BLISS: There are four principal basic things of attaing full bliss - (1) The things&nbsp;<br>
which are connected with soul and which are special and near such as one's own good. (2) the things&nbsp;<br>
which are connected with body, such as physical health, (3) the things which have got no connection&nbsp;<br>
with body though near it, such as wealth, family members, relatives and (4) the things which unite the&nbsp;<br>
attributes of soul and earn them for soul, such as grace, guidance. These are the four items of&nbsp;<br>
spiritual bliss.<br>
(1) First basic thing of bliss: The things which are connected with soul and special and near are&nbsp;<br>
acquired by good conduct and with the extension of branches of faith. Knowledge of faith is of two&nbsp;<br>
kinds - I spiritual knowledge and worldly knowledge. Knowledge of the attributes of God, His angels and&nbsp;<br>
His apostles is spiritual knowledge. The worldly knowledge is of two kinds - to give up necessity of&nbsp;<br>
greed and anger called self-control and to proceed keeping justice and righteousness after abstaining&nbsp;<br>
from the urge of greed. God says: Don't exceed in measurement and establish the scale of justice and&nbsp;<br>
don't decrease in measurement - 55 : 9Q. Full justice is such a state of moderation which does not&nbsp;<br>
exceed the limit, nor reduces it and their balance is even.<br>
FOUR THINGS DRAW NEAR GOD+There are four things which bring a man near God - (1) spiritual knowledge,&nbsp;<br>
(2) knowledge of duties, (3) self-control, (4) and justice. Without physical bliss, they do not become&nbsp;<br>
perfect and this is again of four kinds-(1) health, (2) strength, (3) beauty and (4) long life. These&nbsp;<br>
four gifts again do not become perfect without things beneficial to body which are again of 4 kinds&nbsp;<br>
-(1) wealth, (2) family members, (3) name and fame and (4) relatives. These are also not beneficial&nbsp;<br>
unless the followings are not adopted -(1) guidance, (2) injunctions of God, (3) efforts and (4) God's&nbsp;<br>
help. There are therefore sixteen gifts in total and basically they are of four kinds which are&nbsp;<br>
interconnected and which are absolutely necessary. What is necessary for the next worldly fortune is&nbsp;<br>
faith and good conduct and there is no alternative for men but acquisition of these attributes by&nbsp;<br>
efforts as<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	93<br>
there is nothing for man but what he strives for. There is no fortune for man in the next world without&nbsp;<br>
acquisition of merits in this world. So for acquisition of attributes of soul, knowledge of the above&nbsp;<br>
things is necessary. In order to acquire purity of character, physical health along with we,..ith,&nbsp;<br>
honour and relatives is necessary.<br>
<br>
QuestAW: What is the reason that wealth, honour, relatives and name aA fame are necessary for a man to&nbsp;<br>
get happiness in the next world?<br>
<br>
Answer: These are like the wings of a bird to fly to the destination.<br>
<br>
(1) Wealth: A poor man is sometimes unable to gain perfection. He is just like a warrior who runs to&nbsp;<br>
fight without arms or like a bird of prey which roams to catch prey without wings. For this reason, the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said: How good is lawful wealth for a pious man. He also said: How good is the help of wealth&nbsp;<br>
for God-fear? Why will it not be good when a great deal of time is spent in search of wealth, dress,&nbsp;<br>
house and subsistence unless there is wealth. Many troubles keep such a man away from Zikr and Fikr. He&nbsp;<br>
is also deprived of the merits of pilgrimage, Zakat and charities. A certain pious man was asked: Which&nbsp;<br>
is the thing called gift? He replied: Wealth, as a poor man has got no happiness. He was again asked&nbsp;<br>
about gifts. The pious man said: Security is also a gift as a fearful man has got no rest. He was again&nbsp;<br>
asked: What are the other gifts? He said: Peace arising out of self-control as a patient has got no&nbsp;<br>
happiness. He was again asked: What are the other gifts? He said: Youth, as there is no happiness in&nbsp;<br>
old age? These are the gifts which help towards the gifts of the next world. For this reason, the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said: If one gets up at dawn with health of body, mind free from fear and with daily provision,&nbsp;<br>
he acquires as it were the whole world.'<br>
<br>
(2) Children, wives and members of family: It is nott secret how useful are the wives and children. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said about wife: A religions wife is a help towards religion. He said regarding children: When&nbsp;<br>
a man dies, all his pious acts are closed up except three things - a pious issue who prays for him etc.&nbsp;<br>
We have mentioned this usefulness of children and other things in the chapter of marriage and it should&nbsp;<br>
not be repeated here.<br>
It l<br>

(3) Relatives: They add to the strength of a pious man. If he has no such relatives, his works increase&nbsp;<br>
and he gets no leisure in religious services.<br>
(4) Name, fame and influence: These are means to remove dishonour and disgrace. In their absence, the&nbsp;<br>
enemies may give him trouble and oppressors may create trouble for him in his works and thus these&nbsp;<br>
things may keep away his mind from the remembrance of God. The mind of a believer is his principal&nbsp;<br>
thing. So honour and influence may remove these things from a man. God says: Had God not removed one&nbsp;<br>
party by another party, the world would have been destroyed - 2 : 2518. Influence has got no meaning&nbsp;<br>
unless the opinion of the people are brought under control.<br>
Question: What gift is therein the honour of relatives?<br>
Answer: The Prophet said: The leaders are from the Quraish. For this reason, the Prophet was born in&nbsp;<br>
the most respectable family out of the families of the children of Adam. The Prophet said: Choose for&nbsp;<br>
your semen women of your equal ranks. He also said: Give up impure green tree. The people asked him.&nbsp;<br>
What is impure green tree? He said: A beautiful woman of bad family. A woman of good family is gift.<br>
Question: What is the meaning of physical gift?<br>
Answer: It means health of body and long life, as without them, knowledge and action donot become&nbsp;<br>
perfect. The Prophet said: To spend the whole time in divine service is a great fortune. Beauty is also&nbsp;<br>
a gift. It is useful for the next world for two reasons - (1) an ugly appearance is reprehensible to&nbsp;<br>
nature. The application of a beautiful man is acceptable and its influence falls in the minds of men.&nbsp;<br>
So it is a strength which can help towards God. The pious men said that face and eyes are mirrors of&nbsp;<br>
mind. They also said: A broad forehead tells what is in mind. Once Caliph Mamun cut off the name of an&nbsp;<br>
ugly man from the list of soldiers. When soul shines, appearance becomes bright. The Prophet said: Seek&nbsp;<br>
good from those having beautiful face. Hazrat Omar said : When you send messengers, search for those&nbsp;<br>
having good appearance and good men. The jurists said that if for the purpose of Imamate in prayer two&nbsp;<br>
men are equal in qualities, he who has got better appearance shall be Imam. God says : He gave him&nbsp;<br>
increase in knowledge and body.<br>
Question :God says : There are your enemies in your wives and children. So beware of them-64: 14. God&nbsp;<br>
says : Your wealth and children are a trial-64: 15. So why has not God treated them and wealth as&nbsp;<br>
gifts?<br>
Answer: Wealth has got benefits as well as dangers, It is like a snake which has got jewel in its&nbsp;<br>
forehead as well as poison. The snake-man saves himself from its poison and takes out its jewel from&nbsp;<br>
it. Who knows how to take its jewel, snake is a good thing for, him, but it is dangerous to others who&nbsp;<br>
catch it. He who dives in ocean to collets jewels and emeralds from its bottom knows how to save&nbsp;<br>
himself. He who does not know the modes of diving and swimming will destroy himself. Similar is the&nbsp;<br>
case with wealth. To him who knows its use, it is a gift and to him who misuse it, it is a danger. For&nbsp;<br>
the above reason, God termed wealth as Khair or a good thing, Similar is the case with name, fame,&nbsp;<br>
honour, wives, children and relatives.<br>
Every man is like a boy and wealth is like a snake and the Prophets are like the experienced&nbsp;<br>
snake-charmers. What can not do any harm to an experienced snake-charmer can do harm to a boy. So the&nbsp;<br>
people are like boys under the care of the Prophets. The Prophet said : I am to you just as a father to&nbsp;<br>
his son. The Prophet also said: You are roaming around the fire like insects and I am catching hold of&nbsp;<br>
your loins to save you.' Their responsibility to save their followers from destruction is great as they&nbsp;<br>
were not sent but for this purpose. Nobody has got any share in excess of what is necessary for him,&nbsp;<br>
although there is no sin in keeping excess wealth. Don't keep yourself confined in excess wealth,&nbsp;<br>
rather spend jt, as there is poison in hoarding it and there is jewel in spending it. When wealth is&nbsp;<br>
taken according to needs and excess wealth is spent, it is not reprehensible. Every traveller should&nbsp;<br>
take in his journey what is necessary for him and not overload himself. Similar is the case with a man&nbsp;<br>
walking in the path of religion. The Prophet said : Any man among you should keep such worldly wealth&nbsp;<br>
which a man in journey takes with himself.' The pious man spend their excess wealth in the way of God.&nbsp;<br>
The Prophet once said that the rich man will enter paradise with great difficulty. Then his companion&nbsp;<br>
Abdur Rahman- b-Auf sought his permission to gift away all his wealth to which he gave permission.&nbsp;<br>
Gabriel then came down and said : Tell him to spend his wealth for giving food to the poor, clothes to&nbsp;<br>
those who have got no cloth and to entertain guests.<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES<br>
95<br>
96	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV GUIDANCE : There are three stages of guidance:<br>
<br>
1. The first stage of guidance is to know the paths of good and bad, This is seen from the following&nbsp;<br>
verse : I have showed him two him two paths. God says : I gave guidance to the people of Samud but they&nbsp;<br>
liked misguidance in place of guidance-41: 17 Q. The religious scriptures, the apostles and power of&nbsp;<br>
wisdom are the materials of this guidance and jealousy. pride, attachment to the world are the&nbsp;<br>
obstacles of this guidance. God says : It does not make the eye sight blind, but it makes blind the&nbsp;<br>
hearts which are in the breasts. The causes which make the hearts blind are love for the world and&nbsp;<br>
habits. God says: They say, shall we follow a man among us? This ignorance leads the people to&nbsp;<br>
misguidance.<br>
<br>
2. The second stage of guidance is the guidance through<br>
efforts of special people. This comes after the advent of general<br>
guidance. God leads a servant from one condition to another. This comes as a result of continued&nbsp;<br>
efforts. God says: I will surely show My paths to those who strive hard for My cause - 29: 69Q. In&nbsp;<br>
another verse, He says: God gives increased guidance to those who walk in the paths of guidance-47:17.<br>
<br>
3. The third stage of guidance comes after the second. It is a kind of light which rises in the world&nbsp;<br>
of prophethood and sainthood after perfection of character and conduct and by which a man can reach to&nbsp;<br>
such a world to which he cannot reach by intellect and 'wisdom and which is not possible to attain by&nbsp;<br>
efforts learning and wisdom. This is the highest stage of guidance. The other kinds of guidance are&nbsp;<br>
only preliminaries and screens. God says regarding this guidance: Say, God's guidance is the real&nbsp;<br>
guidance - 2 : 12Q. He named it a real life in the following verse: I brought one back to life who was&nbsp;<br>
dead and granted him a light with the help of which he walks amongst men - 6 :122Q. God says: He whose&nbsp;<br>
breast God has expanded is on light from Him-39:22.<br>
<br>
WILL TO WALK IN PATHS OF GUIDANCE: This will arises out of mind. God says: I have given (Rushd) will to&nbsp;<br>
walk on good path to Abraham and I am congnisant of it - 21 : 51Q. So Rushd means such a guidance which&nbsp;<br>
leads to good fortune and gives incentive towards that. To know the modes of acquisition of fortune is&nbsp;<br>
called Rushd. He who finds guidance may not find<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	97<br>
Rushd or to move according to that guidance. So Rushd is better than guidance.<br>
Tasdid: are efforts with body and mind to reach the cherished goal. So guidance gives clue to true&nbsp;<br>
path. Rushd generates strong will to tread on it and Tasdid is efforts to,put that will into action by&nbsp;<br>
moving the bodily organs.<br>
Ta'yeed is help from unseen quarters. It is the combination of all the above attributes. God says: I&nbsp;<br>
helped him with the Holy Spirit-2: 86.<br>
The above gifts are the elements of the next world. When these qualities are united in a man, God gives&nbsp;<br>
him additional gifts of clear understanding, attractive ear, fore-sight and humble heart and wips out&nbsp;<br>
what prevents him from religion and gives him such honour which saves him from the oppressions of the&nbsp;<br>
ignorant. Each of these four items gives rise to sixteen virtues which also give rise to other&nbsp;<br>
attributes. Thus there grows a chain of help and at last it falls upon the ultimate cause (God).<br>
GOD'S INNUMERABLE GIFTS: Know, 0 dear readers that God created inanimate objects, such as stone, iron,&nbsp;<br>
copper and other mineral substances. They have got no growth and do not take food. Plants are more&nbsp;<br>
perfect than mineral substances as there is a kind of strength in them with which they draw juice from&nbsp;<br>
the earth through their principal arteries. When they gain strength, other arteries come out of them.&nbsp;<br>
But they cannot move and search for food. Animals are therefore more perfect than plants. Among&nbsp;<br>
animals, man has got the highest perfection for the following reasons.<br>
SENSATION OF TOUCH: When fire touches him, he flees away from it. This is the first attribute of&nbsp;<br>
animals without which they cannot go on. Nose has been created for man with which he takes smell. Then&nbsp;<br>
eyes have been created for-him-to-see things near an distant and ears to hear and-tongue to taste.&nbsp;<br>
These things would not have be_ en--st iicient without the strength of perceptionjn_thi~&quot;front portion&nbsp;<br>
of head. By its help, it is known whiehThing is bitter and which is sweet. Without it eyes would have&nbsp;<br>
seen a thing as yellow. Then you have been given intellect with the help of which you can understand&nbsp;<br>
everything. You can understand whether, a thing is beneficial or injurious at present and in future.&nbsp;<br>
The greatest intellect is Knowledge about God, His<br>
98<br>
PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	99<br>
wonderful creations and his workings in the universe. Your five organs then work as police on behalf of&nbsp;<br>
the king-soul. Each of them has been assigned a special function to perform news of colour, voice,&nbsp;<br>
smell, taste, cold, heat and other attributes. These are the gifts on you arranged in order. Sight is a&nbsp;<br>
power and eye is its instrument. There are ten different screens in the eye circle, some are open, some&nbsp;<br>
are secret and some secret screens are woven like the spider's net. Some screens are dried, some are&nbsp;<br>
wet, some are white like egg and some screens are like ice. The form, mode, length and breadth of each&nbsp;<br>
screen of eye are different. If any attribute of a screen is mixed with that of another eye sight&nbsp;<br>
becomes curbed. This is true of only one organ. Now guess the wonderful creation of ear, nose and other&nbsp;<br>
organs.<br>
GREED AND WILL: There are also different kinds of gifts in the creation of greed and will. There are&nbsp;<br>
many diseased men who do not take beneficial food owing to lack of greed. Things of greed are sought&nbsp;<br>
for and reprehensible things are hated. So God created in you greed for food and made it strong in you.&nbsp;<br>
It urges you to take food and thereby you remain alive. That gives rise in :.you sexual passion which&nbsp;<br>
preserves dynasty. You will be struck with wonder if you think and ponder how He created uterus, how a&nbsp;<br>
foetus comes into being out of mixture of the blood of menses and semen, how males and females are&nbsp;<br>
created, how semen comes out from the back of a male and mixes with the ovary of a female, how it&nbsp;<br>
becomes a lump of flesh, how head, hand, feet, belly, back and other organs of the body are formed. All&nbsp;<br>
these are gifts of God.<br>
ANGER: Greed is not alone sufficient for you and many injurious things are coming to you from all&nbsp;<br>
around. Therefore anger has been created in order to drive them off. It is not alone sufficient for&nbsp;<br>
future benefit and for that will has been created. It is guided by knowledge and intellect.<br>
INSTRUMENTS OF STRENGTH AND MOVEMENTS: The following are the instruments which give strength to the&nbsp;<br>
body as a result of which the different organs have got<br>
movements.<br>
Two Hands: Two hands are long and fit for catching hold of things. There are many sinews, joints and&nbsp;<br>
other technicalities by which the hand may be spread and bent at will. Then the fingers<br>
have been created with a plan with the thumb at the end. If the fingers would have been joined&nbsp;<br>
together, your necessities would not have been met.<br>
Mouth: You lift your food with your hands and put it in your mouth. Had it not been the case, you would&nbsp;<br>
not have lived. It is the medium to send food to the stomach. In order to chew food, teeth have been&nbsp;<br>
created and the teeth of upper jaw have been placed upon those of the lower jaw for the purpose of&nbsp;<br>
crushing food. There are teeth for crushing and teeth for cutting.<br>
Tongue takes the food on all sides and places it under teeth for crushing. Then look to your saliva&nbsp;<br>
which gives water to the food when it is dry. Behind this tongue, there is a fountain of water out of&nbsp;<br>
which saliva comes and helps wetting. Then look to the wind pipe and the throat, how they help the food&nbsp;<br>
to reach the<br>
Stomach has got a peculiar shape and form. The gas which is produced by the internal organs helps&nbsp;<br>
cooking of food in the stomach and digestion. To he right side of stomach is liver and to its left&nbsp;<br>
spleen and before it there is the sheet of fat and behind it is the flesh of backbone. Gas arising out&nbsp;<br>
of them enters the stomach for which food is digested and such a juice comes out of it as becomes fit&nbsp;<br>
to enter the veins of blood. That becomes then like barley water. There are many sinews of liver which&nbsp;<br>
have got many mouths. Food enters them. It is made of a mixture of blood and looks like a clot of&nbsp;<br>
blood. God created spleen and gall bladder and for each expanded mouth upto liver has been created.&nbsp;<br>
Gall bladder draws out the yellow refuge and spleen takes out oily black things and as a result pure&nbsp;<br>
blood remains. Then God created the glands of urine which have got long necks towards the liver. God&nbsp;<br>
takes out sinews from the liver and spreads them throughout the body, some of them are secret and some&nbsp;<br>
open. Therein there runs pure blood which reaches the entire body. There are veins and sub-veins just&nbsp;<br>
like the leaves of a tree. If there is something wrong in gall bladder and it can not draw out the&nbsp;<br>
refuge, blood become impure and the result is the disease of jaundice, erysipelas etc. If the spleen is&nbsp;<br>
diseased, it can not draw out black refuge and as a result there grows the disease of leprosy,&nbsp;<br>
elephantiasis etc. When liquid cannot go towards throat, there grows the disease of dropsy. Then you&nbsp;<br>
can imagine how wonderful is the creation of human body.<br>
100	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
Therefore look to the gifts of God and be grateful to Him for all that you have got from Him.<br>
THE SEAT OF LIFE IS HEART: Life is like the fire of a lamp and heart is the seat of that lamp. The&nbsp;<br>
black blood in heart is like the thread of lamp and the food of the thread is oil. So the life.&nbsp;<br>
strength that runs through the body is like the light of a lamp in a house. When the oil of the lamp&nbsp;<br>
finishes, the lamp of life extinguishes. This occurs according to the plan and purpose of God. This&nbsp;<br>
life is a material thing but soul which God termed in His verse as Ruh is a spiritual thing which&nbsp;<br>
intellect cannot grasp. But it can be explained by high celestial light which is more honourable than&nbsp;<br>
intellect. A boy can understand things of his ideas but he cannot understand the objects which can be&nbsp;<br>
grasped by intellect as he is placed then in the lower stage. An elderly man can understand things of&nbsp;<br>
intellect, but he cannot understand what is behind intellect as he has not reached the highest stage&nbsp;<br>
which is gained by the light of certain and sure faith. So the pious men said that he who cannot know&nbsp;<br>
himself cannot know God. About this soul, God says: They ask you about soul. Say it is from the order&nbsp;<br>
of God. God says: 0 satisfied soul, return to your Lord, well pleased with Him and well pleasing&nbsp;<br>
Him-89:30Q.<br>
BASIC GIFT OF FOOD: There are many items of food and God's gift regarding food are innumerable. Food is&nbsp;<br>
of three kinds- vegetables, fruits and crops. We shall discuss here about crops and that is the&nbsp;<br>
principal food. We shall take up the seed of wheat. God says: I shower rain and split up the earth and&nbsp;<br>
grow therein seeds, grape seeds, seeds of creepers and seeds of olive trees. To grow them, air is&nbsp;<br>
necessary and so for this purpose soft cultivated land is necessary, so that air may enter therein, God&nbsp;<br>
says: Isend strong wind producing abundant rain. When water is necessary, God created canals, seas,&nbsp;<br>
oceans and fountains and sends winds to carry water to the fields.<br>
Now look to the sun and the moon. He made them subservient and see how the sun makes the earth warm&nbsp;<br>
inspite of its great distance and thereby crops and fruits enjoy it, how by the help of the moon fruits&nbsp;<br>
become ripe and assume colour and hue. For this reason, if any tree is in shadow, it cannot grow for&nbsp;<br>
want of the rays of the sun and light of the moon. When you sleep under the sky, you will suffer from&nbsp;<br>
cold for its coolness. So the moon gives moisture to the crops and fruits. There is also a<br>
Vol-IV. THE BOOK OF, CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	101<br>
purpose for the creation of each star in the sky. God instructs us to say: 0 our Lord, you have not&nbsp;<br>
created this in vain. He also says: 'I have not created the heavens and the earth and what is between&nbsp;<br>
them out of sports.' The world is like a man and everything in the world is like the organs of the&nbsp;<br>
body. As all the organs of the body help your body, so everything in the world help the world.&nbsp;<br>
Everything in the word is the workmanship of God and as such God can be well understood from His&nbsp;<br>
wonderful creations. So food is perfected by the sun, moon, water, wind, star etc.<br>
TRANSPORTATION OF FOOD: All the foods cannot be obtained from the same place. So God created merchants&nbsp;<br>
who travel all over the world and gather them according to the needs of a particular country. God made&nbsp;<br>
the love of wealth strong over them and for that they undertake arduous and hazardous journey to gather&nbsp;<br>
foodstuffs. In this act, sometimes boats are sunk and wealth is looted by robbers. So God taught them&nbsp;<br>
how to make boats and ships.<br>
PURIFICATION OF FOOD STUFFS: Look to a piece of bread and look to what elements are necessary for&nbsp;<br>
getting a bread. At first field is cultivated and for that cows, bullocks and buffaloes and ploughing&nbsp;<br>
machines are necessary. Then weeds are plucked out and then seeds are sown. Then crops are reaped and&nbsp;<br>
thrashed out. Then bread is prepared when wheats are crushed and made powders. For this, many men,&nbsp;<br>
machines, irons, woods are necessary.<br>
GIFT OF CREATION OF ANGELS: It has been stated that the angels come down to correct the Prophets and to&nbsp;<br>
show them the paths of guidance and to take revelations to them from God. They are divided into three&nbsp;<br>
classes - (1) angels of the earth, (2) angels of heaven and (3) angels for carrying the Divine Throne.&nbsp;<br>
So look how God engaged the angels for procuring food for you and for your guidance. For every organ of&nbsp;<br>
yours, rather for every part of a tree, at least seven angels has been entrusted. It varies from seven&nbsp;<br>
to one hundred. They supply food to each vein and sinew as food does not move by itself but it is taken&nbsp;<br>
from one place to another by angels. Each angel has been assigned a function of his own and none&nbsp;<br>
interfers with the functions of another. The angels of sky help the angels of the earth and the angels&nbsp;<br>
of Throne help the angels of the sky. Above all, the Almighty helps them all.<br>
102	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	103<br>
Question: Why is one angel not sufficient for all works?<br>
Answer: Man is different from angel. There is not a single angel who possesses more than one quality.&nbsp;<br>
Each one of them has been assigned a special work. The following verse gives such an indication: There&nbsp;<br>
is none of us but for whom there is not an assigned work.' For this reason, there is no hatred, rancour&nbsp;<br>
or quarrel in them. Their works is like the work of our five organs. Eye is to see but not to hear.&nbsp;<br>
Nose is to take smell and not to hear. Angels are prone to divine service unlike a man who is prone to&nbsp;<br>
good and bad. They obey what God orders them to do and they glorify God night and day. Some of them&nbsp;<br>
always are engaged in bow, some in prostration some in standing. There is no rest in their works. They&nbsp;<br>
are gifts of God for men.<br>
God says to men: 'Give up open and secret sins.' Man is not always cognisant of his secret sins-hatred,&nbsp;<br>
doing injury to others etc.<br>
There are two gifts in each breath, one gift is that when a man gives out a breath, the burnt gas in&nbsp;<br>
heart comes out. If it does not come out he would be ruined. In taking breath, the life of air is&nbsp;<br>
si6ved up in heart. If breath is chocked up, his heart is burnt because of cutting of the life of air.&nbsp;<br>
In each of 24 hours, a man breaths one thousand times. There are ten moments in each breath. On account&nbsp;<br>
of this thousands of gifts come to your body in each moment. Now imagine what innumerable gifts come&nbsp;<br>
from God.<br>
CAUSES OF MAN'S BEING UNGRATEFUL: Man cannot express gratefulness to God as he is not cognisant of&nbsp;<br>
God's gifts owing to his ignorance. He thinks that recitation of all praises due to God by tongue is&nbsp;<br>
sufficient to express gratefulness. He does not know that if he does his works according to the&nbsp;<br>
injunctions of God and if he fulfils the purpose of a thing for which it is created, he will be&nbsp;<br>
expressing gratefulness for the thing.<br>
The first cause of his being ungrateful is that he does not consider some gifts as gifts as all are&nbsp;<br>
enjoying those gifts in common just as air water fire. If there is want of air for a moment, all will&nbsp;<br>
be destroyed. He who has got eye-sight will not be seen to express gratefulness for his eye-sight. When&nbsp;<br>
he becomes blind and then gets eye-sight, he expresses gratefulness. Once a man<br>
complained to a wise man of his poverty and expressed sorrows. The wise man asked him: Will you like to&nbsp;<br>
be blind if you get 10,000 dirhams? He replied: I don't like to be blind. He again asked him: Will you&nbsp;<br>
like to become dumb in exchange of ten thousand dirhams? He said: Never. He asked him again: Will you&nbsp;<br>
like that your two hands and feet are cut in exchange of 20 thousand dirhams? He said: Never. He asked&nbsp;<br>
him: Will you like that you become mad in exchange of ten thousand dirhams? He said: Never. The pious&nbsp;<br>
man said: Should you not feel ashamed to your Creator that He has given you a gift of fifty thousand&nbsp;<br>
dirhams but yet you are not expressing gratefulness for them to Him?<br>
It has been narrated that a learned man was hard pressed with poverty. He had not an inch of land. One&nbsp;<br>
night he dreamt that a man was saying to him: Do you like that you get a thousand dirhams and in&nbsp;<br>
exchange you forget the chapter An'am of the Quran? He said: Never. He again asked him: Do you like&nbsp;<br>
that you forget the chapter Cow in exchange of a thousand dirhams? He said: Never. Then he asked him&nbsp;<br>
thus of several chapters and he replied the same. Then he said: You have got profit of one lac dinars&nbsp;<br>
yet you are complaining. When he got up from sleep, he was pleased and his grievances vanished away.<br>
The saint Samad went to a certain Caliph with a pot when he was drinking water in a glass. The Caliph&nbsp;<br>
said to him: Give me advice. The saint Samad said: If you are not given a sip of drink in exchange of&nbsp;<br>
your kingdom when you are thirsty, will you not spend all your resources to get it? The Caliph 'said:&nbsp;<br>
Surely, I would spend everything. The saint said: If it is not given to you inspite of your kingdom,&nbsp;<br>
will you not give up your kingdom? The Caliph said: I will surely do it. The saint said: In that case,&nbsp;<br>
don't remain content with your kingdom, because is not equal even to a glass of water.<br>
Three things are found in every man-intellect, conduct and knowledge. There is no such a man who is not&nbsp;<br>
satisfied with his given intellect. He believes that he is the wisest man and prays little for more&nbsp;<br>
intellect. Even he who has got no intellect is pleased with his position. So for his satisfaction he&nbsp;<br>
should feel grateful to God. Regarding conduct, there is no such man who does not find fault with&nbsp;<br>
others and for that he hates him. Regarding knowledge, there is no such man who has got no<br>
104	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	105<br>
speciality regarding his secret thinking. He becomes ashamed if<br>
the people come to know of it. About these three gifts, every man knows them God made some believers&nbsp;<br>
and not unbelievers. He gave them life and not made them dead, made them men and not beasts, made them&nbsp;<br>
males .and not females, made them healthy and not unhealthy, made them qualified and not guilty. It is&nbsp;<br>
wonderful that man considers the gifts of God as insignificant as he looks to one who is superior to&nbsp;<br>
him in wealth and does not look to one who is inferior to him and so does not consider God's gifts on&nbsp;<br>
him as great. More wonderful it is that he looks towards one who is inferior to him in religion but not&nbsp;<br>
to him who is superior.<br>
For this reason, the Prophet said: He who looks to one who is inferior to him regarding worldly affairs&nbsp;<br>
and look's to one who is superior to him in religious matters, is recorded by God as a patient and&nbsp;<br>
grateful man. He who looks to one who is superior to him regarding worldly matters and inferior to him&nbsp;<br>
in religious matters, is not recorded as a patient and grateful man. The Holy Prophet ;said: God does&nbsp;<br>
not make one free from want who does not consider himself as above want even after getting signs from&nbsp;<br>
God. It has been said with a look to the gift of learning. The Prophet said: Surely the Quran is a&nbsp;<br>
valuable gift. There is no wealth after it. The Prophet said: If one who has been given the Quran by&nbsp;<br>
God thinks that another man is more fortunate than him scoffs at the gifts of God. The Prophet said: He&nbsp;<br>
who does not read the Quran it a melodious voice does not belong to us. He also said: Sure faith is a&nbsp;<br>
sufficient gift. A certain pious man of yore said: God said in a certain revealed book: I make My gift&nbsp;<br>
perfect on a servant when I make him free from want of three things - his having no necessity to go to&nbsp;<br>
a king his having no necessity to go to a physician, his having no necessity of what his brother has&nbsp;<br>
got. A certain poet said to this effect.<br>
Your fixed provision must come to you,<br>
your health and security must remain.<br>
If you get up at dawn, being brother of sorrow. Your life will never be happy.<br>
The Prophet said: He who gets up at dawn with peaceful mind, sound health and with the day's provision&nbsp;<br>
in hand is given as it were the gifts of the whole world. The people in general do not express&nbsp;<br>
gratefulness for these three things as well as for the<br>
faith which will take them to the abode of peace. He whose insight has been opened does not remain&nbsp;<br>
satisfied except with Marfat and sure faith even if he is given the wealth from the east to the west.<br>
The saint Rabi-b Khashim was a man of very deep insight. He dug a grave within his house. He tied up&nbsp;<br>
his food along with his neck and used to go to this grave and say; 0 Lord, take me back to the world&nbsp;<br>
that I may do good works. Then he used to say: 0 Rabi, what you wanted has been given to you. Now&nbsp;<br>
engage yourself in divine service and you will not be again sent back. This is the medicine for one who&nbsp;<br>
remains aloof from expressing gratefulness. He should know that when gratefulness for a gift is not&nbsp;<br>
express, the gift takes a back turn and does not come back again. For this reason, the saint&nbsp;<br>
Fazil-b-Iyaz used to say: You should stick to the expression of gratefulness for your gifts. If gifts&nbsp;<br>
go away from a nation they seldom come back to them. A certain sage said: Gift is like a wild beast.&nbsp;<br>
Keep it confined by gratefulness. There is in Hadis that if gifts descend upon a man profusely, the&nbsp;<br>
necessity of his expressing gratefulness becomes great. When he neglects them it prepares itself to go&nbsp;<br>
from him. For this reason, God says: God does not change the condition of a people till they themselves&nbsp;<br>
change it - 13:11.<br>
PATIENCE OF GRATEFULNESS: From what has been described above, it is seen that every created thing is a&nbsp;<br>
gift of God: It is also seen from this that there is really no existence of any danger and difficulty.<br>
Question: If there is no danger and difficulty, what is the meaning of patience? If on the other hand,&nbsp;<br>
there is danger and difficulty, what is the meaning of gratefulness? How can a man express gratefulness&nbsp;<br>
in dangers and difficulties.<br>
Answer: There are dangers and difficulties as there are gifts. If there are gifts, there arises the&nbsp;<br>
necessity of dangers and difficulties. To get relief from a danger is a gift and to be deprived of a&nbsp;<br>
gift is a danger. Gift is divided into two- limitless gifts and limited gifts. The example of limitless&nbsp;<br>
gift is the attainment of the fortune of nearness to God in the next world or of faith and good conduct&nbsp;<br>
and the things that help, these two things. The meaning of limited gift is that it is a gift from one&nbsp;<br>
point of view and a danger from another point of view. For example, wealth is a gift as it helps&nbsp;<br>
religion and it is also a danger as it acts contrary to<br>
106<br>
religion. Similar is the division of danger in to limitless danger and limited danger. The former is to&nbsp;<br>
be away from God in the next world and the danger of infidelity, sin and bad conduct in this world.&nbsp;<br>
Poverty, disease and other calamities, are limited dangers as they are in this world and not in the&nbsp;<br>
next. Limitless gratefulness is necessary for limitless gifts. Though wealth is a gift, yet it becomes&nbsp;<br>
a cause of destruction, so much so that the owner is even killed for its sake. Similar is the case with&nbsp;<br>
health.<br>
So there is no gift in this world which has got no possibility of turning into danger. There is also no&nbsp;<br>
calamity which has got no possibility of turning into gift. There are many men whose good lies in&nbsp;<br>
poverty and disease. Had they been sound in health and solvent in riches, they would have grown&nbsp;<br>
rebellious and naughty. God says: If God had given His servants abundant riches they would have surely&nbsp;<br>
become rebellious in the earth. God says: Never, man is inordinate as he sees himself free from want.&nbsp;<br>
The Prophet said: God saves his believing servant from this world though He loves him just as one of&nbsp;<br>
you saves a patient from water. Such is the condition of sixteen kinds of gifts, such as wives,&nbsp;<br>
children and relatives. There lies therein fortune and also misfortune. Knowledge is a gift but it&nbsp;<br>
sometimes becomes a danger. At that time, ignorance is a bliss. When a man does not know the time of&nbsp;<br>
his death, it is a bliss for him. Had he known it, his life would have been troublesome. Similar is the&nbsp;<br>
case with the secret sins of a man. If his relatives would have known them, he would have fallen from&nbsp;<br>
their estimation. There is good is not knowing some matters - the time of resurrection, the blessed&nbsp;<br>
night, the auspicious moment of Jumma day.<br>
Question: Patience and gratefulness are opposed to each other. How can they unite? Patience does not&nbsp;<br>
come but in calamity and gratefulness does not come but in happiness.<br>
Answer,. One thing becomes an object of happiness for one purpose and a cause of sorrow for another.&nbsp;<br>
purpose. So patience is in calamity and gratefulness is in happiness. There are five matters in&nbsp;<br>
poverty, disease, fear and worldly calamities. A wise man becomes grateful being pleased with them.<br>
(1) First matter: In every calamity or disease, there is a greater calamity or disease. So for a lesser&nbsp;<br>
calamity or disease, a man should be grateful.<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	107<br>
(2) Second matter: is that the calamity or disease is in this world and not in his religion. Once a man&nbsp;<br>
asked the saint Sahal Tastari: A thief stole all my household properties. He said: Be grateful to God.&nbsp;<br>
If the devil entered your heart, he would have robbed your Tauhid. Which thing do you prefer? Jesus&nbsp;<br>
Christ used to Pray: 0 God, don't give me trouble in my religion. Hazrat Omar said: God granted me four&nbsp;<br>
gifts out of each calamity that befell on me. (1) It has not entered into my religion, (2) a greater&nbsp;<br>
calamity has not come and (3) I have not been deprived of pleasure therein. (4)1 hoped for rewards&nbsp;<br>
therein. He who has got power over you to inflict 100 stripes should get gratefulness from you if he&nbsp;<br>
inflicts on you only ten stripes. Once a pious man was walking on the road. Some one threw a basketful&nbsp;<br>
of refuges over his head. At once he expressed gratefulness to God and fell in prostration. Being asked&nbsp;<br>
the reason of his prostration, he said: I was awaiting to be thrown into Hell fire but as only ashes&nbsp;<br>
were thrown on me, I had prostration of gratefulness. God however gives respite to the unbelievers and&nbsp;<br>
the great sinners. God says: I give them respite, so that their sins may increase.<br>
(3) Third matter. There is no such sin of which punishment is not delayed upto the next world. The&nbsp;<br>
calamities of this world reduce the punishment of the next world though the latter will last for long.&nbsp;<br>
It is true that he who is given punishment for a sin in this world will not be punished in the next&nbsp;<br>
world for the same for the second time as the Prophet said: When a man commits any sin and suffers for&nbsp;<br>
that in the world, God is more honourable to inflict on him punishment for the second time for the&nbsp;<br>
same.<br>
(4) Fourth matter. These disasters and calamities were recorded in original book of fate which must&nbsp;<br>
come.<br>
(5) Fifth matter. The rewards of disasters and calamities are more than them. The worldly calamities&nbsp;<br>
show path towards the next-world for two reasons:<br>
First reason: It is that though medicine is bitter and distasteful, it is a bliss for a patient.&nbsp;<br>
Similarly medicine to remove a sin is bitter but it is a bliss in the end. When he will see the&quot;&nbsp;<br>
rewards of calamities in the nex: world he will be grateful to God just as a boy when he attains age&nbsp;<br>
expresses gratefulness-to a teacher for beating him and teaching him lessons of'good behaviour.&nbsp;<br>
Calamities are just like bitter lessons to a,.man<br>

<br>
108	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
walking in the path of God. Once the Prophet looked at the sky and laughed. On being asked the reason,&nbsp;<br>
he said: I wonder at the fate of a believer. If He recorded happiness in his book of fate, he is&nbsp;<br>
pleased with it and that is better for him. If He recorded sorrows for him, he is also pleased with it&nbsp;<br>
and that is better for him.<br>
Second reason. The root of destructive sins is attachment for the world, the root of the cause of&nbsp;<br>
deception. If the gifts are not mixed with calamities, they lead the mind to enjoy the worldly&nbsp;<br>
enjoyments and pleasures. Ultimately it becomes difficult for him to give them up. For this reason, the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said: This world is a prison for the believers and paradise for the unbelievers'. Calamities&nbsp;<br>
are gifts from God. So one should remain satisfied with them, just as he remains satisfied with a&nbsp;<br>
bitter medicine in hope of recovery. Every calamity in this world is like a bitter medicine which is&nbsp;<br>
troublesome at present but a bliss in the long run. This world is like a palace of a king. People enter&nbsp;<br>
it through the door of grace and come out of it through the door of grave. He who fixes his love for&nbsp;<br>
the place of the world, falls into danger. Whoso's mind is aloof from that, it is a gift for him.<br>
<br>
REWARD OF PATIENCE IN CALAMITIES: The Prophet said: God said: When I give calamity to the body of a&nbsp;<br>
servant or to his wealth or children and he proceeds forward keeping patience, I shall feel ashamed in&nbsp;<br>
setting up balance for him on the Resurrection Day. He also said: When a man falls into danger and says&nbsp;<br>
according to the order of God 'We are for God and to him we shall return, 0 God, give me protection in&nbsp;<br>
my calamity and leave for me good therefrom.&quot; God does for him accordingly. The Prophet said: God says:&nbsp;<br>
The reward of one whose two eyes I have robbed is that he will live in My house forever and will look&nbsp;<br>
constantly towards My face. It has been narrated that a man asked the Prophet of God: My wealth has&nbsp;<br>
gone and body is diseased. The Prophet said: There is no good in one whose wealth has not gone and&nbsp;<br>
whose body is not diseased. When God loves a servant, he examines him with a calamity. When he falls&nbsp;<br>
into it, He keeps patience. The Prophet said: The rank of a man is not earned near God by any of his&nbsp;<br>
actions till his body is not attacked with any disease which raises him to such a rank. Hazrat Khabbab&nbsp;<br>
reported: We once came to the Prophet and saw him covered with a sheet of cloth under the shade of the&nbsp;<br>
Ka'ba. We<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	109<br>
complained to him: 0 Prophet of God, don't you invoke God to help us? At this, his face became red with&nbsp;<br>
rage and then he said: There were such men among your predecessors who were buried alive. There were&nbsp;<br>
such men who were sewn to pieces by saws. Yet they did not turn back from religion. Hazrat Ali&nbsp;<br>
reported: He who is confined by the king unjustly and as a result dies becomes a martyr. If as a result&nbsp;<br>
of beating he dies, he becomes a martyr. The Prophet said: Not to complain of your troubles and of your&nbsp;<br>
pains appertain to the glorification of God. Abu Darda'a reported: You are born for death, you erect&nbsp;<br>
buildings for destruction, you covet for what will not last and give up what will last. Three&nbsp;<br>
undesirable things are good for you - poverty, disease and death. The Prophet said: When God wishes&nbsp;<br>
good of a man and establishes love with him, He sends down upon him troubles and calamities and&nbsp;<br>
afflicts him with mishaps. When he prays to God, angels say: This voice is acquainted with us. When he&nbsp;<br>
prays to Him second time and says 0 Lord God says, 0 My servant, I am present, fortune for you. I have&nbsp;<br>
given you what is good for you and I have kept deposited with Me what is better for you. When there&nbsp;<br>
will be resurrection, the pious will be brought and their actions will be weighed in the Balance - the&nbsp;<br>
actions of those who prayed, those who paid Zakat, those who fasted and those who made pilgrimage. Then&nbsp;<br>
those who were afflicted with calamities will be brought but their book of deeds will not be opened in&nbsp;<br>
their presence. Rewards will be rained over them as calamities were thrown over them. Those who were&nbsp;<br>
happy and safe in the world will see the high rank of those who suffered troubles and calamities and&nbsp;<br>
say: Alas, how good it would have been if the flesh of our bodies were severed by scissors. For this&nbsp;<br>
reason God says: Surely the patient will be given full rewards without account. Hazrat Ibn Abbas&nbsp;<br>
reported that a Prophet complained to God and said: 0 Lord, a believer obeys you and gives up&nbsp;<br>
disobedience to you but you keep the world distant from him and send down upon him troubles. The&nbsp;<br>
unbeliever does not serve You dares against You and commits sins. You remove from him dangers and&nbsp;<br>
difficulties and give him varieties of comforts and riches. What is its reason? God then revealed to&nbsp;<br>
him: The people are Mine and dangers and calamities also are Mine. Everything glorifies My praise. When&nbsp;<br>
I see the sins of a believer, I keep away the world from him and present to him dangers and&nbsp;<br>
difficulties. I expiate his sins by the worldly<br>
calamities and he becomes dear to me and I give him the rewards<br>
110<br>
PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	111<br>
of his virtures. If an unbeliever does good in the world, I give him abundant wealth, remove from him&nbsp;<br>
calamities and give him rewards of his good actions in the world. At last he comes to Me with sins and&nbsp;<br>
I give him punishment for his sins. It has been reported that when the following verse was revealed: He&nbsp;<br>
who does evil will get requital' of it - 4 :120Q. Hazrat Abu Bakr said: How can there be joy after this&nbsp;<br>
verse? The Prophet said: 0 Abu Bakr, may God forgive you. Why, will you not fall ill? Will not&nbsp;<br>
calamities fall on you? Will you not be sorry? These are the requital of your sins.<br>
The Prophet said: When you see a man engrossed in sins and yet he gets his cherished objects, know then&nbsp;<br>
that He is delaying his punishment. Then he recited this verse; When they forgot what they were&nbsp;<br>
admonished with, I opened the door of everything for them till when they were engrossed in what they&nbsp;<br>
were given, I caught them all of a sudden. Hazrat Ali reported: Shall I not inform you of such a verse&nbsp;<br>
of the Quran which is greatly hoped for? They said: Inform us. Then he recited: Whatever calamity&nbsp;<br>
befalls on you, it is on account of what your hands have wrought and He forgives much-42 :80Q.<br>
The Prophet said: No person swallows sips dearer than two sips to God, s -p of anger which he swallows&nbsp;<br>
with patience and sip of calamity over which he keeps patience. There is no drop dearer to God than two&nbsp;<br>
drops - one drop of blood which is shed in the way of God and one drop of tears which falls in&nbsp;<br>
prostration in the grim darkness of night and which nobody sees except God. There are two steps of a&nbsp;<br>
servant very dear to God-one step taken for performing compulsory prayer and another step for keeping&nbsp;<br>
the tie of blood.<br>
Caliph Omar-b-Abdul Aziz said at the time of the death of his son: 0 dear son, my getting you in my&nbsp;<br>
scale of virtues is dearer to me than your getting me in your scale of virtures. In other words, if you&nbsp;<br>
die before me, I would get you in my scale of virtues. The son said: 0 father, what you love is dearer&nbsp;<br>
to me than what I love.<br>
Some learned man said: God sends down calamity after calamity on a servant till he walks upon the earth&nbsp;<br>
free from sins. The saint Hatem Asam said: On the resurrection day, God will bring before four classes&nbsp;<br>
of men four persons are proofs - (1) Hazrat Solaiman before the rich. (2) Hazrat Ishaq before the poor,<br>
(3) Hazrat Eusof before the slaves. (4) and Hazrat Ayub before the patients.<br>
<br>
It is reported that Hazrat Zakaria flew from the unbelievers and took refuge to a tree. They found clue&nbsp;<br>
to this tree and cut the tree to two pieces by a saw. When the saw touched the head of Hazrat Zakaria,&nbsp;<br>
he raised a shriek. Then God revealed to him: 0 Zakaria, if you raise shriek for the second time I will&nbsp;<br>
remove your name from the register of prophethood. At this Hazrat Zakharia bite his teeth and kept&nbsp;<br>
patience till he was hewn to pieces.<br>
Loqman advised his son: 0 dear son, a religious man is tried by calamities, just as gold is tried by&nbsp;<br>
fire. When God loves a party of men, He gives them trial. He becomes pleased with those who remain&nbsp;<br>
satisfied with it and he becomes displeased with those who become displeased with it.<br>
<br>
The saint Ahnaf-b-Qais said: One day I awoke in the morning and complained of pain in my teeth. I told&nbsp;<br>
my uncle: I could not sleep last night owing to pain in my teeth. I told him of this three times. He&nbsp;<br>
said:-You complain much of pain of one night, but nobody knows that I became blind for the last 20&nbsp;<br>
years. God revealed to the Prophet Ozair: When any calamity befalls on you, don't complain of it to My&nbsp;<br>
created beings but tell Me of your complaint, just as I do not make complaint of you to My angels.<br>
MERITS OF CALAMITIES: You may say now that calamities are better than gifts. Shall we not then pray for&nbsp;<br>
calamities? The answer is in the negative as the Prophet used to pray for being saved from the&nbsp;<br>
calamities of this world and the next. He and the other Prophets prayed: 0 Lord, give us good in the&nbsp;<br>
world and in the next. They used to seek refuge from the calamity of enemies. The Prophet said: You&nbsp;<br>
pray to God for calamities while I pray to him for peace of mind. He said: Pray to God for peace of&nbsp;<br>
mind. Nobody has been given a greater good than peace of mind except sure faith. The meaning of sure&nbsp;<br>
faith is peace of mind. Mental peace is better than physical peace. The saint Mutref-b-Abdullah said:&nbsp;<br>
That I am forgiven and that I express gratefulness for that is dearer to me than that calamity falls on&nbsp;<br>
me and I keep patience.<br>
<br>
Calamity is considered as a gift for two reasons. One reason is that calamity has got connection with&nbsp;<br>
more gifts, either<br>
112	PATIENCE AND GRATEFULNESS	Vol-IV<br>
temporal or spiritual. Another reason is the hope for getting rewards in calamities.<br>
The saint Samnun prayed: I have got no joy except without Thee. Examine me as Thou liked. After this,&nbsp;<br>
Samnun fell ill of constipation. He used to tell the boys: Pray for your false speaking uncle Samnun,&nbsp;<br>
as I am not successful in examination.<br>
Which is better - patience or gratefulness? There is a great deal of differences in this matter. Some&nbsp;<br>
say patience is better and some to the contrary. The Prophet said: Of all the things that you have been&nbsp;<br>
given the best is certain faith and firm determination of patience. God says: The patient will be given&nbsp;<br>
full rewards without account. The Prophet said: A grateful eater is equal to a patient fasting man.&nbsp;<br>
From the above, it appears that patience is greater than gratefulness. The Prophet said: Jumma is the&nbsp;<br>
pilgrimage of the poor and women's jihad is to live with husband in a good manner. He said: Patience is&nbsp;<br>
half of faith. The Prophet said: Of all the Prophets. Solaiman will go last to Paradise, as he enjoyed&nbsp;<br>
rule of kingdom. Abdur Rahman-b-Auf will go last to paradise among my companions, as he was enormously&nbsp;<br>
rich.<br>

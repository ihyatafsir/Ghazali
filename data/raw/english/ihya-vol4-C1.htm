PREFACE<br>
<br>
The Book of Constructive Virtues' is the fourth and the last volume of Imam Gazzali's world renowned&nbsp;<br>
master piece Ihya Ulum- id-Din or the Revival of religious learnings. This work is an attempt to&nbsp;<br>
translate the fourth part of the Ihya not too literally but in substance from the original written in&nbsp;<br>
Arabic. It consists of two parts. 'The Book of Constructive Virtues' consists of two parts. Part II&nbsp;<br>
deals with love and attachment, will and intention, meditation and self examination, pondering over&nbsp;<br>
good, death and subsequent events, death of the Prophet and four caliphs and events before and after&nbsp;<br>
Resurrection and Paradise and Hell. A litteral translation is avoided in order to omit the unnecessary&nbsp;<br>
arguments of sects and sub-sects then prevailing in the world and also to omit the sayings of the sages&nbsp;<br>
of less importance. But it should be noted that no verse of the Holy Quran or the Hadis of the Holy&nbsp;<br>
Prophet has been omitted in this translation.<br>
Translations of the other parts of Ihya will soon be out of press very shortly by the grace of Almighty&nbsp;<br>
God with full details of the Ihya and a short life and activities of Imam Gazzali, the greatest thinker&nbsp;<br>
and philosopher of the Muslim world.<br>
I pray to the Almighty Allah that He may guide the people of the world in accordance with the teachings&nbsp;<br>
of the Holy Quran and Sunnah and the spirit in which the Ihya was written by Hujjatul Islam (the Proof&nbsp;<br>
of Islam), a title received by Imam Gazzali and about which it has been said &quot;If all the books of Islam&nbsp;<br>
were destroyed, it would be but a slight loss if only the Ihya of Gazzali were preserved.&quot;<br>

PART I<br>
CHAPTER I<br>
TAUBA (REPENTANCE)<br>
MEANING OF TAUBA<br>
Tauba means repentance for a sin by taking promise not to do the same evil again and to return to God.&nbsp;<br>
Repentance is the beginning in the life of a person who intends to walk in the path of religion. It is&nbsp;<br>
the root of the fortune of those who are successful, the first step of a disciple, the key to guidance&nbsp;<br>
to the straight path, the weapon of purification of those who wish to come close to God and a dear&nbsp;<br>
thing of all prophets. So it is no wonder that man will commit sins. Hazrat Adam introduced the rule of&nbsp;<br>
repentance and he repented for the sin he committed in the past. It is necessary for man to return to&nbsp;<br>
God penitently after commission of sins. He who does good deeds is close to God and he who does always&nbsp;<br>
sinful deeds is close to the devil. He who does good deeds after commission of a sin is a real man.'<br>
FOUR PRINCIPLES OF TAUBA<br>
Human nature is mixed up of two elements. Every man has got the nature of angel, nature of man and&nbsp;<br>
nature of devil. He who does always sinful acts keeps connection with the devil. He who does always&nbsp;<br>
good acts keeps connection with angels Nothing can give salvation to a man except the fire of&nbsp;<br>
repentance. So repentance or Tauba has got four cardinal principles.<br>
(1) The fist principle is form of repentance, its limit and its knowledge. It is the bounded duty of a&nbsp;<br>
man to make repentance after sin. If it is sincere, it is accepted.<br>
(2) The second principle is to turn away from sins, to know the major and minor sins, to know the&nbsp;<br>
duties towards God and to men, to know man's progress and retrogression for virtues and vices and to&nbsp;<br>
know the causes of minor sins turning into major sins.<br>
8	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	9<br>
(3) The third principle is to know the conditions of Tauba, search into past sins, expiation of sins&nbsp;<br>
and the classes of those who repent.<br>
(4) The fourth principle is to know the causes of making Tauba and the medicines of persons addicted to&nbsp;<br>
vices.<br>
FIRST PRINCIPLE - FORM OF TAUBA,<br>
KNOWLEDGE AND LIMIT<br>
Repentance consists of three elements-knowledge condition and action. Knowledge of Tauba is necessary&nbsp;<br>
for condition, as condition is necessary for action. God promulgated this rule in the physical and&nbsp;<br>
spiritual worlds. Knowledge is necessary for repentance that the harms of sin are very severe. When you&nbsp;<br>
will know it with faith and truth, you will then become repentant for losing an object of love. When&nbsp;<br>
repentance prevails over the mind, another condition arises in mind which is called will or desire. It&nbsp;<br>
has got connection with present, past and future actions. Its connection with the present means that he&nbsp;<br>
wills to give up the sin which he has committed. Its connection with the future means that he becomes&nbsp;<br>
determined to give up to the last stage of his life the sin for which he is to be. separated from his&nbsp;<br>
dear ones. It connection with the past means that he wills to make expiation for not doing an action&nbsp;<br>
which he should have done.<br>
So to know and search for doing good deeds as mentioned above is the first condition. This knowledge&nbsp;<br>
means faith and certainty of belief, as the meaning of faith is to know with truth that sin is&nbsp;<br>
destructive like poison. The certainty of belief means to believe as sure the immutable truths. The&nbsp;<br>
light of this faith is enkindled in the heart when the fire of repentance rises up. As a result his&nbsp;<br>
heart becomes dejected. He becomes then like a person who remains in darkness and then the rays of the&nbsp;<br>
sun shine on him or he sees his beloved if the screen is removed from him.<br>
So knowledge, repentance and determination have got connection with the giving up of sin in the present&nbsp;<br>
and future and repentance of the past sins. If these three elements are united in person in an orderly&nbsp;<br>
manner, it is called Tauba or repentance but most people confine Tauba within repentance and do not&nbsp;<br>
consider the other two elements. The Prophet said: Tauba means repentance. It is such a fire of&nbsp;<br>
repentance as burns the heart and even attacks the back-bone. Hazrat Sahal Tastari said: To change<br>
bad habits into good habits is Tauba. Solitude, silence and eating lawful things are conditions of&nbsp;<br>
perfection of Tauba.<br>
MERITS OF TAUBA<br>
Tauba is Wazeb or compulsory. There are different classes of sojourners of religion. (1) One class are&nbsp;<br>
short-sighted. They cannot cross their blind faith at every step. So the Quran and Sunnah of the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet are necessary for them at every step (2) Another class of sojourners are fortunate. God&nbsp;<br>
expanded their breasts for Islam and they are upon light from their Lards and cross the impregnable&nbsp;<br>
stage of the path with care at the slightest hint. The light of the Quran and faith shines upon their&nbsp;<br>
hearts. A slight hint is sufficient for them owing to the brilliance of light. They know that&nbsp;<br>
repentance is compulsory in order to gain permanenet good fortune and security from permanent ruin. The&nbsp;<br>
meaning of Tauba is to give up sins and to determine to do goocrdeeds.<br>
God says: 0 believers, be repentant to God all together that you may get salvation-24 :31. God says : 0&nbsp;<br>
believers, repent to God with sincere penitance-66 : 8. Sincere penitance means to return to God from&nbsp;<br>
sin in order to inncur pleasure of God in a condition free from doubt. God says: God loves those who&nbsp;<br>
are penitent and pure-2: 220. The Prophet said : A penitent man is dear to God. He who returns from sin&nbsp;<br>
is like one who has got no sin.<br>
The Prophet said: Think that a man went to a vast field with a camel loaded with food and fuel. He&nbsp;<br>
slept there after leaning his head. When he awoke, he did not find his camel there. Then he began to&nbsp;<br>
search for it running to and fro and said after getting tired of hunger and sun: I will go to my former&nbsp;<br>
place to sleep such a sleep that it may cause my death. Then he placed his head upon his hands and&nbsp;<br>
slept there to meet with death. When he awoke, he found his camel standing before him with food and&nbsp;<br>
water. His joy then knew no bounds. God becomes more pleased with the repentance of a believer than his&nbsp;<br>
joy in another narration, the Prophet said: He was beside himself with joy and said in an ecstasy of&nbsp;<br>
joy : I am your Lord and You are my servant.<br>
Hazrat Hasan Basari said: When God accepted the penitance of Adam, the angels blessed him and Gabriel&nbsp;<br>
and Michael came to him and said : 0 Adam, God accepted your repentance and cooled you eyes. Adam said&nbsp;<br>
: 0 Gabriel, what will be my rank if after acceptance of this repentance some questions are asked?<br>
r<br>
10<br>
TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	11<br>
God then revealed to him : 0 Adam, there will come sorrows and difficulties over your followers and&nbsp;<br>
repentance will be open to them. Whoever among them will repent. I will accept his repentance as I have&nbsp;<br>
accepted yours. Whoever seeks My forgiveness. I will not be miser in accepting his forgiveness as I am&nbsp;<br>
near and accept invocations. 0 Adam, when I shall resurrect the repentant men, they will smile and&nbsp;<br>
enjoy and their repentance will be accepted.<br>
Tauba is compulsory according to the unanimous opinion of the jurists. It means to have knowledge that&nbsp;<br>
sin and disobedience to God are harmful and remove the sinner away from God This appertains to&nbsp;<br>
compulsory faith. Tauba is firm determination to give up sin in the present and future and repentance&nbsp;<br>
for past sins. This shows that Tauba is compulsory.<br>
Question: His Man Got Freedom of Action?<br>
Answer: Man has got freedom of action but it is not opposed to our opinion that everything is the&nbsp;<br>
creation of God and man's freedom of will is also the creation of God. When man wishes, his wish has&nbsp;<br>
been created for him. For instance, God created hand, sound and delicious food. He created in mind this&nbsp;<br>
knowledge that the greed will be pacified by this food. He created also the contrary thought whether it&nbsp;<br>
would be good or injurious if the greed for food is satisfied and whether this kind of food is&nbsp;<br>
agreeable or not. He also created this understanding whether it has got any bar or not. If these causes&nbsp;<br>
are united. there comes the will to take that food. As a result of two conflicting thoughts and the&nbsp;<br>
greed for food, will comes in and that is called freedom of will. When all the elements are fulfilled,&nbsp;<br>
there comes will. When God creates the will and makes it firm. He allows his sound hand to extend&nbsp;<br>
towards food, as the unification of will and strength leads compulsorily to action. These two things,&nbsp;<br>
will and strength, are the creations of God.<br>
Out of these creation, one thing is guided to another according to a well arranged plan created also by&nbsp;<br>
God. There is no change of God's plan. He does not move the hand to an well-arranged writing, till He&nbsp;<br>
creates strength in it, till He gives it life and till He creates firm will. He does not raise up firm&nbsp;<br>
will till He creates. greed in mind. He does not create this greed fully till He creates this knowledge&nbsp;<br>
or understanding whether it will<br>
conform to nature in the present or future. He does not create this understanding without other causes&nbsp;<br>
which make movement of limbs, will and knowledge. So understanding and desire of mind follow firm will&nbsp;<br>
and strength. Will comes before movement of bodily limbs. This rule is prevalent in every action. So&nbsp;<br>
everything is created by God and one thing of His creation depends upon another thing. For instance,&nbsp;<br>
will comes after understanding, understanding comes after life, and body comes before life. So the&nbsp;<br>
creation of body is necessary for life but not life for body. Similarly creation of life is necessary&nbsp;<br>
for creation of understanding and not creation of understanding for life. Understanding does not come&nbsp;<br>
if there is no life. Understanding has been created to make will firm and not for creation of will.&nbsp;<br>
Will does not come without life and understanding.<br>
When nature is subject to some condition, the condition is created to accept that nature. Then that&nbsp;<br>
nature can be acquired from the strength of fate and God-given gift. When nature has not uniformity&nbsp;<br>
owing to the cause of condition, so also there is uniformity for occurrence of an event owing to the&nbsp;<br>
action of God. Man should necessarily be fit for occurrence of this uniformity. God says : I have&nbsp;<br>
created everything according to a measure. With regard to the original fate, there is this verse: 'My&nbsp;<br>
order is not but in a twinkling of an eye.' Man is subject to his fate. Owing to the fate or&nbsp;<br>
pre-measurement. He created the strength of movement in the hand a writer after creation firstly of an&nbsp;<br>
attribute named strength, secondly after creation in his mind a firm determination and thirdly after&nbsp;<br>
creation owing to this determination in mind understanding and fourthly knowledge of cognition. When&nbsp;<br>
these four matters subservient to fate from the unseen world appear in the body of a man, the&nbsp;<br>
inhabitants of the world know it. But before it remains hidden in the unseen world. Then the&nbsp;<br>
inhabitants of this world say : 0 man, you have moved, you have thrown arrows, you have written, but&nbsp;<br>
proclamation comes from behind the screen : When you have thrown arrows, you have not thrown them. It&nbsp;<br>
is God who has thrown them. When you fought, you have not fought. It is God who have fought with them.&nbsp;<br>
God will punish them through your hands.<br>
GOD IS AGENT OF ACTIONS<br>
Then sperficial learned man becomes blind and understands it. From his standpoint, he says that man has&nbsp;<br>
got freedom of will.<br>
12<br>
TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	13<br>
Some say that man has got freedom of will but he has got no<br>
connection with pre-measurement or destiny. Some adopt the<br>
middle course and say that man's action is subject to efforts. If the<br>
doors of heaven would have been opened to them and they<br>
looked to the spiritual and unseen world, it would have surely<br>
been disclosed to them that every opinion is true from one standpoint or the other, but there is defect&nbsp;<br>
in it. God knows the open and secret words. He does not disclose it except to those prophets with whom&nbsp;<br>
He is pleased. He who has entered the limit of His pleasure knows only the things of this world and not&nbsp;<br>
of the spiritual world. But a man of spiritual world knows that God is the Creator of everything and&nbsp;<br>
there is no master of action except He.<br>
Question : You have said that every opinion is true. Cite an example for clear understanding.<br>
Answer: Know, 0 dear readers, that a party of blind men went to see an elephant which they never see it&nbsp;<br>
before. When they reached the elephant, they touched it. One blind man touched its feet, another, its&nbsp;<br>
ear, another its trunk. They at once exclaimed We have known an elephant. When they went away, other&nbsp;<br>
blind men asked : How is an elephant ? They all described its different forms. The blind man who&nbsp;<br>
touched its feet said that the elephant is like a post. The blind man who touched it trunk said : the&nbsp;<br>
elephant is not as the other blind man has described.<br>
The elephant is a hard subestance and not a post and it is long. One who touched its ear said : By God.&nbsp;<br>
the elephant is smooth like a seeve. The saying of each is true in some respect or the other, but none&nbsp;<br>
could give a full description of an elephant. The difference of many men over a single matter is like&nbsp;<br>
this. This gives clue to spiritual knowledge.<br>
Tauba is compulsory with its three ingredients, knowledge of sin, repentance for sin and giving up of&nbsp;<br>
sin in future. Tauba is compulsory after commission of sin, as a believer can understand that sin is&nbsp;<br>
harmful. He who does not give up sin gives up a portion of faith. The following Hadis proves it. When a&nbsp;<br>
man commits fornication he commits when he is not a believer. That fornication is injurious like poison&nbsp;<br>
is not known to him. This is said with regard to the faith which returns to spiritual knowledge. At the&nbsp;<br>
time of committing of fornication, he loses<br>
faith that fornication is injurious and that it keeps him far away from God, just as when a physician&nbsp;<br>
says : It is poison and don't take it. If inspite of this warning, a person take:, it, it can be said&nbsp;<br>
that he has taken it as he disbelieved it. This does not mean that he does not believe in the existence&nbsp;<br>
of the physician or that he has got no knowledge of medicine, but it means that he does not believe&nbsp;<br>
that poison is harmful, as he who knows the effect of poison, cannot accept it.<br>
<br>
BRANCHES OF FAITH: There are more than seventy. branches of faith. The highest branch is &quot;There is no&nbsp;<br>
deity but God&quot; and the lowest branch is to remove injurious things from path ways. This truth is found&nbsp;<br>
from the following instance. A. man is not composed with one thing only but with more than seventy&nbsp;<br>
elements. The highest element is soul and life and the lowest element is removal of undesirable things&nbsp;<br>
from the body, such as trimmning moustache nails etc. Faith is also like a man. The highest element of&nbsp;<br>
faith is Tauhid. Faith does not remain if Tauhid goes just as a body does not live if life goes out of&nbsp;<br>
it. He who has got only Tauhid is like a man chopped of hands and feet and he is near death. Similarly,&nbsp;<br>
if a person has got nothing except basic faith, his tree of faith is about to crumble down. If a great&nbsp;<br>
tempest attacks it, it faces the angel of death. The faith of one, if not established upon firm&nbsp;<br>
foundation and not expressed in actions does not stand firm at the great tempest or the attack of the&nbsp;<br>
angel of death. The condition of his end becomes fearfuk The faith which is watered constantly by&nbsp;<br>
divine services remains intact at the time of death.<br>
EXAMPLES OF A SINNER AND A VIRTUOUS MAN<br>
<br>
If a sinner says to a virtuous man : I am a believer as you are a believer, his saying is just like the&nbsp;<br>
saying of a creeping plant to a big tree : I am a tree just as you are a tree. The big tree says to the&nbsp;<br>
creeping plant : You will know soon how false is your claim. At the time of tempest, your root will be&nbsp;<br>
uprooted. The tree of a Refin or gnostics has got the fear to be cut off even at their advent of death.&nbsp;<br>
He who is a sinner does not fear to live forever in hell. His condition is like that of a sound man who&nbsp;<br>
remains immerged in harmful passions and low desires, as he does not fear death owing to his robust&nbsp;<br>
health. He should be said this : A sound man should fear illness and death may come to him if diseases&nbsp;<br>
attack<br>
e<br>
14	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
<br>
him. Similar is the condition of a sinner. He should fear his end and the consequent punishment in&nbsp;<br>
Hell.<br>
So he who commits sin having faith is like the eater who eats food injurious to health. Thus it&nbsp;<br>
continues till he meets with sudden death. Similar is the condition of the sinner. When you give up the&nbsp;<br>
food in this world mixed with poison as injurious, how much necessary is it for you to give up sins&nbsp;<br>
which are injurious in the next world. He who eats poison and becomes repentant, disgraces it from his&nbsp;<br>
stomach by vomiting it at once: When this is necessary in this temporary world, how much necessary is&nbsp;<br>
it to give up sins which are detrimental to the immortal soul ? To repent for sins during life time is&nbsp;<br>
necessary because sin like poison will destroy the ever-lasting happiness of the next world. If the&nbsp;<br>
next world. is destroyed, one shall have to enter burning fire and receive other punishments. Worldly&nbsp;<br>
happiness in comparison with that of the next world is very trifling. There is no end of time in the&nbsp;<br>
next world. Once poison begins to work, the physician cannot cure it. The sinner falls within the&nbsp;<br>
meaning of this verse (36: 8): I have put a bar in front of them and a bar behind them and covered them&nbsp;<br>
up so that they cannot see-36: 91. Spiritual knowledge is the root and worldly knowledge is its branch.<br>
It is now clear to you that faith has got many branches and when a man commits fornication, he does not&nbsp;<br>
remain a believer. The screen which falls on faith is also a branch. At the time of death, it will fall&nbsp;<br>
from the basic faith as a man advances towards death if he loses one limb but still has got life. There&nbsp;<br>
is no existence of faith, without its branches if there are branches, they indicate that there is the&nbsp;<br>
existence of the root, but the existence of the root only does not indicate the existence of the&nbsp;<br>
branches. So spiritual knowledge is the root and worldly knowledge is its branch. Both are linked&nbsp;<br>
together. One cannot go without the<br>
other.<br>
Repentance is compulsory on the part of every Muslim in every condition, as God says : 0 believers, be&nbsp;<br>
'repentant to God all together so that you may get salvation-24 :31. By this verse, all are called to&nbsp;<br>
be repentant. Tauba means to come near God from a distant path and to return from the path near the&nbsp;<br>
devil. Wisdom does not become perfect unless passions, angers and all other vile vices which are the&nbsp;<br>
instruments of the devil and which misguide<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	15<br>
men are brought under full control. Wisdom becomes perfect at the advent of 40 years of age and it&nbsp;<br>
begins after the age of maturity and takes its root at the age of seven year's.<br>
Passion, anger etc. are the soldiers of the devil and wisdom is the soldier of angels. When there is&nbsp;<br>
union of passion and wisdom, clash begins as one does not look at another with pleasure. They are&nbsp;<br>
opposed to each other and the difference between them is that of day and night or light and darkness.&nbsp;<br>
Sexual passion remains strong in youth before perfection of intellect. The soldiers of the devil come&nbsp;<br>
forward at that time. He who is a solider of God has got his intellect shining. God says .The devil&nbsp;<br>
said : I will destroy the children of Adam except a few. If the intellect is firm, strong and perfect,&nbsp;<br>
its first duty is to control the sexual passion and greed and take the self towards divine service.&nbsp;<br>
This is the meaning of Tauba. There is not other meaning of Tauba except this. In other words, to&nbsp;<br>
control the passions and low 'desires of the self, to return from the paths of the devil and to walk in&nbsp;<br>
the path of God. There is no such man whose sexual passion does not appear before his intellect. The&nbsp;<br>
evils of the devil appear before the natures of the angels and the former sits tight in heart before&nbsp;<br>
the latter. So it is the duty of every man to return from the evil tendencies. A poet says :<br>
Think not that Hinda alone is guilty of treachery. Every chaste woman has got sin owing to her beauty.<br>
COMPULSORY TAUBA'S SYSTEMATIC<br>
DESCRIPTIONS<br>
Greed is engrained in human nature from birth. It is the natural passion of man and it is not possible&nbsp;<br>
to go against it. So whoever remains an infidel at the time of maturity, he should turn away from his&nbsp;<br>
infidelity. If he is a Muslim at the time of age and follows the Islam of his parents, he should&nbsp;<br>
understand the meaning of Islam and turn towards real Islam as the Islam of his parents without&nbsp;<br>
understanding brings him no good. This is very hard and difficult. Tauba is directly compulsory on&nbsp;<br>
every man in every condition as he is not free from sins of his bodily limbs. There are traditions to&nbsp;<br>
show repentances and the wailings of the Prophets owing to their sins. If any man is free from sin,&nbsp;<br>
still he is not free from thoughts of sins. If he is free from thoughts of sins, he is not free from&nbsp;<br>
the machinations of the devil as many impure<br>
16	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	17<br>
toughts keep him forgetful of God. The object of Tauba is to return from sin. The Prophet said : The&nbsp;<br>
devil circles round my thoughts, for which I seek forgiveness to God seventy times. When such is the&nbsp;<br>
condition of the Prophet, how is the condition of others?<br>
Question: There is no doubt that the evil thoughts that cross in mind are harmful and to be free from&nbsp;<br>
them is the sign of perfection. Perfection is not compulsory according to Shariat and to return to&nbsp;<br>
perfection, Tauba is necessary. So what is the meaning that Tauba is compulsory under all&nbsp;<br>
circumstances?<br>
Answer. Man is not free from greed from the beginning of his birth. So Tauba is not to give it up, but&nbsp;<br>
it is complete when past sins are enquired into, and one in repentant therefore. If a man follows his&nbsp;<br>
passion, a smoke rises in his heart as a result. When there is layer of smokes in heart, rust fall on&nbsp;<br>
it as a mirror is filled up with smokes out of the breath of men. God says : Never. Rather rust has&nbsp;<br>
fallen on their hearts for what they acquired. When rust is gathered on it, there falls therein seal,&nbsp;<br>
as a mirror becomes ugly if dust after dust falls on it. If it lasts long, it enters into the iron of&nbsp;<br>
the mirror and destroys it. It is therefore not sufficient to give up only dust of passion in future&nbsp;<br>
but it is necessary-also to remove the dusts already gathered. In order to see face in mirror it is not&nbsp;<br>
only necessary that there should be no smoke on it, but all smokes and dusts gathered in the past on it&nbsp;<br>
must be removed. The smoke of sins and passions on heart should be removed by the light of divine&nbsp;<br>
worship. The following Hadis hints at that &quot;Do a good deed after an evil deed. It _will wipe out the&nbsp;<br>
latter.&quot; It is only a good deed that can remove a bad deed according to the law of opposites. It is&nbsp;<br>
only cold that can remove heat. At first, heart remains pure. It assumes black colour for its opposite&nbsp;<br>
actions.<br>
MEANING OF WAJEB: There are two meanings of Wajeb. (1) One meaning is compulsory action which Shariat&nbsp;<br>
fixed as compulsory for all the people and the omission of which is great sin, such as prayer, fast&nbsp;<br>
etc. (2) The second meaning of Wajeb is doing that duty which is outside the control of the ordinary&nbsp;<br>
men and with which search is made to be near the Almighty had to acquire the rank of the highest&nbsp;<br>
religious personalities. To make Tauba from the faults mentioned above is necessary to acquire that&nbsp;<br>
rank, as to make ablution is compulsory for an optional prayer. Ablution is compulsory for a person who&nbsp;<br>
wishes to pray<br>
optional prayer to attain rank. He who remains satisfied being deprived of the rewards of optional&nbsp;<br>
prayer does not require an ablution, as eyes, hands and feet are not compulsory for a man to remain&nbsp;<br>
alive. He who desires to be a full and perfect man, compulsorily requires these bodily organs.<br>
So the basic compulsory subjects are for the ordinary people as they take a man to basic salvation&nbsp;<br>
which is like living with a life. The additional things which lie behind this basic salvation bring&nbsp;<br>
fortune and perfection for which the prophets, saints and the friends of God strived hard and for which&nbsp;<br>
they gave up the pleasures of this worldly life. Even when Jesus Christ took a stone to be used as a&nbsp;<br>
pillow for sleep, the devil came him and said: You have not given up the world for the next world. He&nbsp;<br>
said: Yes, how have you understood it? The devil said: You are using this stone as a pillow is included&nbsp;<br>
within the pleasure of the worgd.Why did you not place your head on the earth? Jesus Christ then threw&nbsp;<br>
away the stone and placed his head upon the ground.<br>
His throwing off the stone is his Tauba or return from that pleasure. To place the head upon the ground&nbsp;<br>
is not compulsory on the general public, but Jesus Christ did so to acquire the highest merit. Do you&nbsp;<br>
not notice that our Prophet threw off a cloth which he put on as it turned away his attention from&nbsp;<br>
prayer owing to its varied colours. It is not compulsory on his followers. He did it to acquire the&nbsp;<br>
highest rank. This is Tauba or return from a slip of mind. Do you not notice that Hazart Abu Bakr&nbsp;<br>
vomited out the milk which he had drunk as he came to know afterwards that it was not earned lawfully?&nbsp;<br>
But it is no sins to eat an unlawful thing unknowingly and Shariat does not make compulsory to take it&nbsp;<br>
out from stomach. Think of these people who were the most informed of men regarding God, God's path and&nbsp;<br>
God's Marfat. You take great care that you may not be deceived by anybody in this world. What a great&nbsp;<br>
care you should take not to be deceived regarding the affairs of God and the next world.',<br>
Abu Solaiman Darani said: If a wise man does not weep during the rest of his life for defect in his&nbsp;<br>
divine service, he shall feel sorrow up to his death. Every moment of life or every breath is a&nbsp;<br>
treasure. There is no exchange of it as it is the basic thing. It will take you to everlasting fortune&nbsp;<br>
and rescue you from everlasting misfortune. If you lose it uselessly and negligently,. you will be a&nbsp;<br>
great loser. If you spend it in sin, you will spoil yotir<br>
18	TAUBA	Vor IV<br>
<br>
best treasure. If you do not weep for this loss, it will be for your mere ignorance. The danger of&nbsp;<br>
ignorance is more than that of all other things. All men are asleep. When they die, they are awake.&nbsp;<br>
Then their poverty will be disclosed to them.<br>
A certain Aref said: If the angel of death informs a man that a<br>
moment only is left for his life his grief rises to such a degree that in exchange of everything in the&nbsp;<br>
world he hopes to get some leisure to get an opportunity to make Tauba for his past misdeeds, but that&nbsp;<br>
is not to be. God says: Spend out of what I have given before death comes to one of you, lest one of&nbsp;<br>
you say: 0 Lord, if you give me a little time, I will make charity and be one of the pious. God does&nbsp;<br>
not tarry a little for anybody when his time comes-63: 10. At the time of that catastrophe, his basic&nbsp;<br>
faith will totter and in this condition his life will end. If he has sent good deeds in advance, his&nbsp;<br>
life will go out with Tauhid. This is his Khatema-bil Khair or end with good condition. If he is&nbsp;<br>
unfortunate, his life will go out in sorrows and anxieties. This is his bad end. For this reason, God&nbsp;<br>
says : Tauba is for those who commit sins out of ignorance and then soon repent, God will accept their&nbsp;<br>
repentance and He is all Knowing, the Wise. Tauba is not for those who commit sins till when death&nbsp;<br>
comes to one of them he says : I now repent-1:16. The Prophet says : Wipe out an evil by doing&nbsp;<br>
thereafter a good act.<br>
LoqMan said to his son: 0 darling, make no delay in making Tuba as death comes suddenly. He who does&nbsp;<br>
not repent without delay lives in two dangers. One of the dangers is that the darkness of sins is&nbsp;<br>
congested in his heart to such an extent that in the end it is transformed in to rust and seal is&nbsp;<br>
created and it can hardly be effaced. The second danger is that unless treatment is made of the&nbsp;<br>
disease, death is sure-and no delay can be made towipe it out. There is therefore In Hadis : Most of&nbsp;<br>
the cries of the dwellers of Hell will be for salvation without delay. He who will be ruined will not&nbsp;<br>
be ruined without sorrow. So his heart becomes black for the present and to secure it by divine service&nbsp;<br>
remains for the future. He remains in such condition up to his death and will return to God with&nbsp;<br>
unsound soul. There is no salvation except for a sound soul. Soul is a trust to man and life<br>
also is a trust to him. Whose ruins these trusts his matter is a<br>
subject of thoughts and anxieties.<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	19<br>
A certain Aref said: God communicates by way of I1ham or inspiration two secret things. One of them is&nbsp;<br>
that when a man is .born from his mother, He says to him : 0 My servant, I have taken you out to the&nbsp;<br>
world pure and clean and I have kept your life to Me as a trust and for that made you secure. I will&nbsp;<br>
look how you observe that trust and I will see how you meet Me. The second subject is that when his&nbsp;<br>
life goes out, God says : 0 My servant, what have you-done with the trust I have kept with you? Have'&nbsp;<br>
you preserved it till you have met Me. I f you have preserved it, I will reward you in full. If you&nbsp;<br>
have ruined it, I will give you punishment as God says: Fulfill My command and I will fulfill Mine. God&nbsp;<br>
says : Those who fulfill their trust and promise-8: 23<br>
CONDITION OF ACCEPTANCE OF TAUBA<br>
<br>
Every sincere Tauba is accepted. Those who observe with the 'inner light and whose souls are bright&nbsp;<br>
know that every soul has Been-created pure and clean and every child has been created on natural&nbsp;<br>
attribute. But men have been polluting its purity and cleanliness with dirt and making it black with&nbsp;<br>
sins. They also know that these impurities on soul can be burnt by the fire of repentance,and the light&nbsp;<br>
of good deeds can remove the darkness of dirts gathered on soul. The darkness of sins has got no power&nbsp;<br>
to live with the light of good deeds as the darkness of night can not live with the light gf day or as&nbsp;<br>
the dirts can not remain, if a cloth is cleaned with soap. So God does not accept a soul polluted with&nbsp;<br>
sins. As a cloth being polluted by foul act can be cleansed with soap and warm water, so a soul being&nbsp;<br>
polluted with passion and greed can be purified of tears of eyes and fire of repentance. As a clean&nbsp;<br>
cloth is acceptable, so a pure and clean soul is acceptable to God. So your soul should be cleansed and&nbsp;<br>
made pure. God says : The soul of one- gets success-which he has made pure.' One soul can recognise&nbsp;<br>
nother soul. He who does not know his soul, how can he know anothe,W soul? He who thinks that Tauba&nbsp;<br>
although sincere will not be accepted, is like a man who thinks that darkness will not go even if the&nbsp;<br>
sunrises or dirt will not go even if a cloth is washed by soap. But soap is not alone sufficient to&nbsp;<br>
remove dirt if it is gathered, layer over layer; on a thing. Similar is fhe condition of sin if&nbsp;<br>
congested in soul. If one says by word of mouth &quot;I repented&quot;, his word is like the word o f a washer&nbsp;<br>
man who says by his tongue; I have washed this cloth.'' Such is the condition of a soul if no, sincere&nbsp;<br>
repentance is made.<br>
20<br>
This is sufficient for acceptance of Tauba for a man with deep insight. There are proofs of the Quran&nbsp;<br>
and Hadis to this effect.<br>
God says: He it is who accepts Tauba from His servants and pardons sins. God says : I am Forgiving,&nbsp;<br>
Accepter of repentance. The Prophet said : God is more satisfied with the repentance of some of you.&nbsp;<br>
This satisfaction means acceptance of repentance and this is the proof of acceptance of repentance. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said : God says : God extends also His hand of forgivenesses towards one who is busy in&nbsp;<br>
commission of sins from night till day break and from day break till night. There are many repentance&nbsp;<br>
fit for acceptance which are not enquired into and there are many enquirers whose repentance is not&nbsp;<br>
accepted. The Prophet said : If you are engaged in the commission of sins which reach even heaven and&nbsp;<br>
then repent, God will accept it. He said : A man will enter paradise even after commission of sins. The&nbsp;<br>
companions asked : 0 Messenger of God, how can it be. He said : After commission of sins, he thinks how&nbsp;<br>
lie can return from them. Thus he will enter Paradise. Our Prophet said : Tauba expiates sins. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said:. He who repents after commission of a sin is like one who has not committed its A Negro&nbsp;<br>
slave once said to the Prophet : 0 Messenger of God, I am engaged in obscene deeds. Have I got any&nbsp;<br>
repentance. He said. Yes, you have, Then he returned from the sins and said : 0 Messenger of God, when&nbsp;<br>
I commit sin, does God see me. He said : Yes, Then the slave gave such a loud shriek that cost his&nbsp;<br>
life..<br>
It is related that when God cursed the devil, he prayed to God for time and He granted him time till&nbsp;<br>
the Resurrection Day. The devil then said : By the honour of your oath, I will not come out of the&nbsp;<br>
heart of a man till there is breath in him. God said : By My honour and glory, I will accept his&nbsp;<br>
repentance till there is life in his body. The Prophet said: A good deed removes an evil deed as water&nbsp;<br>
removes dirt.<br>
Sayings of sages, Sayeed-bin-Mosayyeb said regarding the event of reviation of this verse &quot;He is&nbsp;<br>
forgiving to those who repent, that a man repented after commission of a sin. Then he again committed&nbsp;<br>
that sin and again repented. Then God sent down the above verse. Fazil said: God said : Give good news&nbsp;<br>
to the sinners that if they repent, I will accept it. Give warning to the truthful that if I do justice&nbsp;<br>
in their case, I will punish them. Talge-bin-Habib said : Whatever duties man may do, God is<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	21<br>
much above that, but he should repent morning and evening. Abdullah- bin-Omar said : If a man after,&nbsp;<br>
commission of sin get afrajd in mind, it is effaced from his record of deeds<br>
<br>
It is related that when a Prophet of Banue Israil committed a sin, God revealed to him: By My honour,&nbsp;<br>
if you commit sin another time, I will give you punishment. The Prophet said : 0 my Lord, you are you&nbsp;<br>
and I am I. By your honour, if you do not save me, I may commit another sin. God then saved him. A&nbsp;<br>
certain sage said : If a man commits sins and then repents for his whole life, he shall enter Paradise.&nbsp;<br>
The devil will then say: Alas, why have I thrown him into a sinful act? Ibn Masud one day saw a man&nbsp;<br>
committing a sinful act. He asked him: Is there any repentance for this sin? Ibn Masud first turned&nbsp;<br>
away from him ;and then looking towards him saw that he was shedding tears. He said to him: Paradise&nbsp;<br>
has got eight doors all of which will not be closed or opened. An angel will be entrusted with its not&nbsp;<br>
closing. So act and act and don't be despaired. Abdur Rahman-bin- Abul Qasem said. We were discussing&nbsp;<br>
with Abdul-Rahman about repentance of the unbelievers arld also about the verse of God : If they&nbsp;<br>
desist, He will forgive th9 r past sins. He said : Hope that the condition of the Muslims Will be good&nbsp;<br>
near God. I heard that the repentance of the Muslims after Islam will be like their acceptance of&nbsp;<br>
Islam. Abdullah-b-Salam said: You are narrating the following Hadis after hearing it from the Prophet&nbsp;<br>
or knowing it from the Book of God-When a man commits a sin and then repents for it soon, his sins drop&nbsp;<br>
down sooner than the twinkling of an eye. Hazart Omar said : Sit with those who repents as their hearts&nbsp;<br>
are very soft.<br>
<br>
If is related that a man of Banu Israil were engaged- in commission of sins for twenty years after his&nbsp;<br>
divine service for twenty years. Thereafter when has look was drawn towards a beautiful woman, he said&nbsp;<br>
that his beard had grown grey. He felt grieved for this and he prayed to God : 0 God, I did your&nbsp;<br>
service for 20 years and then committed sins for the last 20 years. If I turn to You now with&nbsp;<br>
repentance, will You accept me? Someone from the unseen said : When you had loved Me, I had loved you.&nbsp;<br>
When you gave me up, I gave you up. When you committed sins again, I gave you a time. If you now return&nbsp;<br>
to Me, I will accept you. Jun-Nun said : There are such servants of God who saturate with the water of&nbsp;<br>
repentance the tree of sins when it grows. The fruits<br>
TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
22<br>
of sorrow and penance then come out of it. They go mad without madness and fool without foolishness.&nbsp;<br>
They are the givers of lessons, speakers and well-informed of God and His Apostle. They drink water&nbsp;<br>
from the cups of purity and remain patient for long in sorrows and difficulties. Then their minds&nbsp;<br>
become eager to sojourn in heavens, their thoughts enter into the mysteries of the spiritual world,&nbsp;<br>
they take shelter in the canopy of repentance and read then the records of sins. As a result fear&nbsp;<br>
enters their hearts and reaches the utmost limit of renunciation embarking in the steps of God fear.&nbsp;<br>
They regard the bitterness of renunciation of the world as sweet and the roughness of bed as smooth.&nbsp;<br>
Even their glands of salvation and the staffs of security grow strong and their souls rise upwards and&nbsp;<br>
enter the garden of fortune. They make enjoyments in the sea of life and sing in the well of&nbsp;<br>
despondency. They cross the bridge of passions and descend into the field of education, drink water in&nbsp;<br>
the tanks of wisdom, embark on the boat of peace and sail in the sea of security with the wind of&nbsp;<br>
salvation.<br>
TAUBA FROM MINOR AND MAJOR SINS<br>
Tuba means to give up sins. If a thing is not known, it is not possible to give it up. When Tauba is&nbsp;<br>
compulsory, the thing by which the condition of Tauba is reached is also compulsory.<br>
CLASSES OF SINS ACCORDING TO<br>
THE NATURE OF MEN<br>
Man has got four natures. It is narrated regarding the wonderful qualities of soul that the nature and&nbsp;<br>
conduct of man are many, but they can be limited within four natures-Godly nature,. devilish nature,&nbsp;<br>
beastly propensity and propensity of ferocious beasts. The reason is that man has been created of&nbsp;<br>
different elements and every element has got its influence.<br>
1. Firstly-Godly nature. To boast, to take pride, to create, to love praise, to love honour and power,&nbsp;<br>
to wish to live forever, to wish to lord over all etc. are the Godly qualities in the man (2) Secondly,&nbsp;<br>
the devilish natures of hatred, rebellion. fraud, cheating, disturbance and all kinds of evils. (3)&nbsp;<br>
Thirdly, beastly propensities like greed for satisfaction of stomach, fornication, theft, eating of the&nbsp;<br>
property of orphans etc. (4) Fourthly, propensities of ferocious beasts, out of which grow the evils of&nbsp;<br>
anger, attack, rebuke, killing, etc. They come in order. Firstly,<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	23<br>
beastly propensities remain strong and then propensities of ferocious beasts come. When these two&nbsp;<br>
propensitiesunite, they make intellect subservient to practise cheating, fraud. This is also the nature&nbsp;<br>
of the devil. At last, the Godly qualities become strong-greed for name and fame, greed for honour,&nbsp;<br>
desire for lordship over people etc. These are the roots of sins and fountains. Sins flow from these&nbsp;<br>
fountains into the bodily limbs. Some sins fall in mind, such as infidelity. hypocrisy, will for doing&nbsp;<br>
harm to men. Some sins fall in eyes and ears, some in tongue, some in stomach and organs of passion,&nbsp;<br>
some in hands and feet and some in the whole body.<br>
Second class of sins-Sin comes from breach of duties towards God and men. The sins arising out of the&nbsp;<br>
breach of duties towards God are to give up prayer, fasting and other compulsory duties. The major sins&nbsp;<br>
arising from breach of duties towards men are to give up Zakat, to kill a man unjustly, to&nbsp;<br>
misappropriate the properties of others, to destroy the rights of others. It occurs in connection with&nbsp;<br>
life, properties, religion, name and fame. The punishment of sins for breach of duty towards men is&nbsp;<br>
sure and the sins of breach of duties towards, God are expected to be pardoned. There is in the&nbsp;<br>
tradition: There are three matters-one matter is fit to bg pardoned, one matter is not fit to be&nbsp;<br>
pardoned and one matter fit to be given up. The matter which is to be pardoned is the breach of duty&nbsp;<br>
towards God. The matter which is not fit to be pardoned is to set up partnership with God. The matter&nbsp;<br>
which is fit to be given up is the breach of rights of men. There is no pardon of that sin unless,the&nbsp;<br>
owner of right forgives him.<br>
Third class of sins-There is difference of opinion with regard to major sins. Sins are divided into two&nbsp;<br>
major and minor. Some say there is no such distinction as major and minor sins, rather whatever is done&nbsp;<br>
against the order of God is a'major sin. This argument is weak as God says : If you give up the major&nbsp;<br>
sins of which you have been prohibited, I shall compensate your minor sins for you and cause you to&nbsp;<br>
enter to an honourable place-4 : 31. God says : Those who give up major sins and indecent acts except&nbsp;<br>
those evil thoughts which arise suddenly in mind. The Prophet said : Five times of prayer and prayers&nbsp;<br>
from one Jumma to another compensate the sins in between them if the major sins are given up. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said : To set up partnership<br>
_. TAUBA	. Vol-IV<br>
24	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	25<br>
with God, to be disobedient towards parents, to kill and to break promise are major sins. The&nbsp;<br>
companions differed and fixed the major sins as four, seven, nine or eleven. Ibn Masud said that their&nbsp;<br>
number is four, Hazrat Ibn Omar said that they are seven. Abdullah-bin-Amr said that they are nine.&nbsp;<br>
Hazrat Ibn Abbas said that they are seventy and the nearest of them is seven. A certain sage said : The&nbsp;<br>
sin for which there is the fire of Hell as a punishment is major sin. Some say that the number of major&nbsp;<br>
sins is not known as the blessed night or the auspicious moment of Jumma is not known. Abu Taleb Makki&nbsp;<br>
said that they are seventeen. He said : I have gathered them from Hadis and from Ibn Abbas, Ibn Masud,&nbsp;<br>
Ibn Omar and other companions. Out of them, four have connection with mind-(l) to set up partnership&nbsp;<br>
with God, (2) to do a sin repeatedly, (3) to be despaired of the mercy of God, (4) and not to fear the&nbsp;<br>
punishment of God. Four have got connection with tongue-(1) to depose falsely, (2) to slander a chaste&nbsp;<br>
woman, (3) to break promise and (4) to make sorcery. Three have got connection with stomach (1) to&nbsp;<br>
drink intoxicant, (2) to eat the property of an orphan, (3) and to enjoy interest with knowledge. Two&nbsp;<br>
have got connection with the sexual organ-(1) to commit fornication and (2) to cohabit with boys. Two&nbsp;<br>
have got connection with hands-(1) to kill (2) and to steal. One has got connection with leg-to flee&nbsp;<br>
away from fighting with the infidels. One has got connection with the whole body-to be disobedient to&nbsp;<br>
parents.<br>
<br>
Comparison makes a sin major or minor. A thing becomes bigger in comparison with a small thing. Again a&nbsp;<br>
thing is called small when compared to a bigger thing than it. If a man lies with a strong woman in the&nbsp;<br>
same bed, his lying is greater than looking at her and smaller than fornication with her. Sins are&nbsp;<br>
divided into three-(1) sins which are known to be major, (2) sins known to be minor and (3) sins which&nbsp;<br>
Shariat has not fixed to be major or minor, Imam Gazzali said : the thing who stands as an impediment&nbsp;<br>
to God's knowledge is a major sin and the thing which ruins life and ruins the means of livelihood is a&nbsp;<br>
major sin.<br>
<br>
Major sin.has get three stages-(1) the thing which stands as an impediment in heart for preservation of&nbsp;<br>
Marfat, (2) the thing which stands as an impediment to the acquisition of God's knowledge or knowledge&nbsp;<br>
of the Prophet is infidelity or disbelief which is the greatest of all major sins. Ignorance is the&nbsp;<br>
screen<br>
between God and His servants and knowledge is the means of doing good deeds. In accordance with the&nbsp;<br>
measure of knowledge about Him, nearness is gained and in accordance with ignorance about Him, there is&nbsp;<br>
distance from Him. Ignorance has got another name named infidelity. He who has got knowledge of Him&nbsp;<br>
cannot remain safe and cannot be also despaired. He travels in these new stages which have got&nbsp;<br>
connection with God's attributes and actions. According to the Quran, there are three classes of&nbsp;<br>
sins-(1) what is known as major sins in the Quran, (2) what is known as not major sins in the Quran and&nbsp;<br>
(3) the sins which have got doubt of being called major sins.<br>
(2) With regard to the second stage of major sins, it is the impediment to save life, as knowledge of&nbsp;<br>
God can be acquired if there is life. So to commit suicide is a major sin, but lower than infidelity.&nbsp;<br>
To cut of hands and feet and the thing which leads to sudden death are majors sins. So also fornication&nbsp;<br>
and unnatural cohabitation are major sins as in a case of this nature there is no fixation of lineage,&nbsp;<br>
and cutting off the existence of man.<br>
(3) The third stage has got connection with properties, as properties are the means of livelihood. It&nbsp;<br>
is not permissible for men to earn them arbitrarily, such as theft, docoity, misappropriation of money.&nbsp;<br>
In four ways, properties may be misappropriated. The first way is to take property secretly or by&nbsp;<br>
stealing. The second way is to eat the properties of an orphan which is also done secretly. The third&nbsp;<br>
way is to misappropriate property by false deposition. The fourth way is to get deposited property by&nbsp;<br>
false oath.<br>
<br>
PUNISHMENT AND REWARD IN<br>
THE NEXT WORLD<br>
Know 0 readers, that this world is visible material world and the next world is invisible spiritual&nbsp;<br>
world. The meaning of this world is your condition before your death and the next world is your&nbsp;<br>
condition after your death. The name of near condition is this world and of distant condition is the&nbsp;<br>
next world. Examples are the only means of describing the next world as we are now living in this&nbsp;<br>
world. God says : I have given these examples for men and none but the wise appreciate them: The reason&nbsp;<br>
is that this material world is like a dream in comparison with the next world. The Prophet said : 'Men&nbsp;<br>
are in sleep. They will wake up<br>
26<br>
after their death.' What occurs in wakeful state is not expressed in dream except in examples which are&nbsp;<br>
subject to interpretation. Similarly what will occur in the next world in wakeful state is not clear&nbsp;<br>
without examples of sleep of this world.<br>
<br>
Once a man came to Ibn Sir in and said : (1) I saw in dream as if there is a seal in my hand with which&nbsp;<br>
I am giving impression in the faces and places of shame. He said : It seems you are a Muzzen and will&nbsp;<br>
proclaim before dawn in the month of Ramzan. He said : You have spoken the truth. (2) Another man came&nbsp;<br>
and said : I saw in dream that I am puring olive oil on my head. He said: Enquire into the condition of&nbsp;<br>
your slave if you have got any. It seems that she is your mother and was a prisoner in your childhood,&nbsp;<br>
as the root of oil is olive tree and it returned to its root. After examination, it was found that she&nbsp;<br>
was his mother and that she was taken a prisoner in his childhood, (3) Another man said to him : I saw&nbsp;<br>
in dream that I am dressing the neck of a swine with a necklace of emeralds. He said : It means that&nbsp;<br>
you are teaching wisdom to underserving persons.<br>
<br>
The interpretation of dream occurs in such a way from the beginning to the end. The Prophets used to&nbsp;<br>
speak to men by way of illustrations and examples as they were ordered to speak to men according to the&nbsp;<br>
degree of the intelligence of men. The intelligence of men is as it were confined to the mist of dream.&nbsp;<br>
Nothing is expressed to men who see anything in dream without examples. When they die, they wake up and&nbsp;<br>
understand that the illustrations are true. For this reason, the Prophet said : The heart of man is&nbsp;<br>
situated within two fingers of the Merciful. Nobody except the wise can understand it. The fools take&nbsp;<br>
it literally and understand this that God has got hands and fingers, from which He is pure. Similarly&nbsp;<br>
the Prophet said : God created Adam according to His imdge. They understand it as material figure and&nbsp;<br>
colour. So they construct the images of God, while He is pure of all forms. Similarly the affairs of&nbsp;<br>
the next world are explained by illustrations: Many take it literaly true. The Prophet said : On the&nbsp;<br>
Resurrection Day, death will be presented in the form of a goat without hairs and it will be&nbsp;<br>
slaughtered. Some say it is a flase Hadis as death has got nobody and goat has got a body. It is just&nbsp;<br>
like the saying of a man: I dreamt that a goat was taken to me and it was slaughtered. It means that&nbsp;<br>
the epidemic disease of the town slaughtered.<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	27<br>
The nutshell of this talk is that the angel who is entrusted with dream presents to human soul in sleep&nbsp;<br>
what is written in the Guarded Tablet. He informs by illustration as a sleeping man cannot understand&nbsp;<br>
it except by illustration. It comes true and its meaning is correct. The illustration that death will&nbsp;<br>
be presented in the next world in the form of a goat without hair is that after the first death of man,&nbsp;<br>
there will be no other death as a slaughtered animal is not expected to come again. There is in the&nbsp;<br>
Quran &quot;Be and it comes into being.&quot; This is explained as unlimited power. It is not possible to explain&nbsp;<br>
the punishments of sins and the rewards of virtues without illustrations. We say that on the&nbsp;<br>
Ressurrection Day, men will be of different classes and their ranks will be also different as in the&nbsp;<br>
world there is difference of fortunes and misfortunes. The next world does not keep this world separate&nbsp;<br>
as the Conductor of the next world and this world is one without having any partner.<br>
MEN WILL BE DIVIDED INTO FOUR CLASSES<br>
IN THE NEXT WORLD<br>
One class are for destruction, one class for punishment, one class for salvation, and one class for&nbsp;<br>
success. The following is the illustration in this world A certain powerful king in order to establish&nbsp;<br>
his kingdom on a firm basis kills some people and they are the destroyed people. He punishes some&nbsp;<br>
persons who are for a certain time but he doesnotkill them. They are those who receive punishment. He&nbsp;<br>
releases some persons who are recepients of salvation. He gives rewards to some persons who are&nbsp;<br>
successful. If the king is just, he classes his subjects on the basis of justice only. He does not kill&nbsp;<br>
ex ept those who deny his sovereigny. He does not punish except those who have got defects in their&nbsp;<br>
service to him. He does not release except those who admit the king's rank and position. He does not&nbsp;<br>
give rewards except to those who spend their lives in his service.<br>
There is also difference in the rewards of' those whe get rewards according to the extent of their&nbsp;<br>
services and helps to the king similarly those who are destroyed get punishment according to the extent&nbsp;<br>
of their mischief and worngdoing. Some are killed outright, the hands and feet of some are cut off and&nbsp;<br>
then killed. Then understand that in the next world also the people will be divided into different&nbsp;<br>
classes. Some will be destroyed, some will get salvation and enter the abode of peace and some<br>
TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
<br>
28	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
will receive rewards. The nearest persons will recieve rewards. The rewarded persons will be of&nbsp;<br>
different classes, some will enter the paradine of Eden; some will enter the paradise of Maoa, some&nbsp;<br>
Ferdous. Similarly those who will receive punishment will be also of different classes. Some will be&nbsp;<br>
given slight punishment, some will be given punishment from one thousand years to seven thousand years.&nbsp;<br>
Similarly those who will be destroyed will be deprived of God's mercy.<br>
STAGES OF THOSE WHO WILL MEET<br>
WITH DESTRUCTION<br>
The perons who will meet with destruction are those who will be deprived of God's mercy. They are like&nbsp;<br>
those persons whom a king kills on account of their opposition and who have been deprived of king's&nbsp;<br>
mercy. Those who deny the existence of God, those who are engaged in worldly persuits and those who&nbsp;<br>
disbelieve God, His Prophets and His books are included within this class. Fortune in the next world&nbsp;<br>
means gaining nearness of God and meeting with Him. This nearness cannot be gained without knowledge of&nbsp;<br>
God. This knowledge arises out of faith and there is its corroboration. Those who deny the existence of&nbsp;<br>
God are the disbelievers deprived of God's mercy. The lovers of God said: We don't fear the fired f&nbsp;<br>
Hell, nor do we hope for the black-eyed Hurs. Our only hope is meeting with our Lord and the lifting of&nbsp;<br>
screen from us. They say: He who serves God in exchange of getting something is dishonourable,&nbsp;<br>
despaired and subject of hatred, He serves God only to get Paradise or to ward off punishment of Hell,&nbsp;<br>
but a lover of God serves Him only to meet with Him. Fire burns only the body but the fire of&nbsp;<br>
separation burns both the body and soul. The fire of separation is enkindled by God which rises up to&nbsp;<br>
the heart. A poet said:<br>
Fire of separation in a lover's heart is high and severe. Fire of Hell in comparison is trifling and&nbsp;<br>
like snow.<br>
He on whom the fire of love is enkindled walks upon fire and runs over the bamboo points and cannot&nbsp;<br>
feel pangs owing to the urge of love. You will see an angry man fighting even after receiving wounds&nbsp;<br>
but not feeling any pain.<br>
Second Stage: Those who will get punishment. They are the people who have got faith but have got&nbsp;<br>
short-comings for neglect to act according to it. The root of faith is Tauhid or faith in the<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	29<br>
unity of God, He who follows his passion accepts it as his deity and not God. He is not a true&nbsp;<br>
unitarian. God says: Say God and then leave them in their useless talks. The real meaning of this is&nbsp;<br>
Give up everything except God. God says in its support: Those who say 'God is our Lord' and then they&nbsp;<br>
firmly stand on it- -60 30. This means that this is the straight path without which Tauhid is not&nbsp;<br>
perfect. This path is more slender than hair and more sharp than sword. This is like the bridge of the&nbsp;<br>
next world. Man strays away little or more from this straight path as he is not free from the&nbsp;<br>
propensities of nature. He goes away from Tauhid in proportion to his going away from this path. This&nbsp;<br>
occurs for two reasons-strength of faith and its weakness and following low desires, more or little.&nbsp;<br>
God said : There is nobody among you who will not come to it (Hell). It is a decree of God. God said&nbsp;<br>
Then I will give those who are God-fearing salvation and I will make the sinners turned down--19 : 71.<br>
<br>
The Prophet said: Some persons will be taken out of Hell after one thousand years and they will cry 0&nbsp;<br>
Merciful.' Hearing this Hadis, Hasan Basari said : Alas ! Had. I been one of those persons ! It is in&nbsp;<br>
the tradition that the man who will come out last of all from Hell will come out of it after seven&nbsp;<br>
thousand years. Some will come out of it like lightning. Some will remain in Hell for seven thousand&nbsp;<br>
years. So there are days, weeks, months and years within this period. Punishment will be meted out&nbsp;<br>
different times for different persons. There will be also different kinds of punishment as a king metes&nbsp;<br>
it out to his subjects. He fines some persons, 'whips some, confiscates, the properties of some,&nbsp;<br>
deports some, beats some, kills the children of some, takes the wives of some as slaves, chopps off the&nbsp;<br>
nose, hands and feet of some. Similary there will be different kinds of punishment in the next world.&nbsp;<br>
The greater the sins, the greater the punishments. There are several kinds of punishement for several&nbsp;<br>
kinds of sins. Those who are adapt in soul give proof of the above by the Quranic verses : God says :&nbsp;<br>
Your Lord is not an oppressor of His servants. He says : Every soul will be given today what it&nbsp;<br>
earned-12: 286. He says :Man shall have nothing but what he strives for. He syas : He shall see even an&nbsp;<br>
atom of good he does and he-shall see an atom of evil hedoes 99:71..<br>
<br>
There will be justice and no injustice, but the scale of pardon and forgiveness will be heavy, as the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said that God had said : My compassion overcame My wrath. God says : If you do a<br>
<br>
30	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	31<br>
good deed, God will increase it and give you abundant rewards from Him. It seems that whose establishes&nbsp;<br>
his faith firm, keeps away from all major sins, does all the compulsory duties and does not do except&nbsp;<br>
minor sins and even these also not repeatedly, his punishment will be confined only within accountings,&nbsp;<br>
because when his accounts will be taken, his virtues will be heavier than his sins. There is in Hadis&nbsp;<br>
that the prayer for five times, Jumma prayer and the fast of Ramazan expiate the sins committed during&nbsp;<br>
the period. Similarly if the major sins are given up, the minor sins are expiated therefore.<br>
DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE FORTUNATE<br>
To enter the highest Paradise or to live near the fortunate one depends upon faith of different kinds.&nbsp;<br>
Faith is of two kinds-blind faith of the ordinary people and faith born out of direct inner sight which&nbsp;<br>
is gained with the expansion of breast by the help of God's light. By virtue of this faith. The&nbsp;<br>
knowledge of everything appears to him and it becomes clear to him that everything will return to God&nbsp;<br>
as there is no existence of any thing except that of God. His attributes and His actions. These are&nbsp;<br>
they who will live near God and reside in the highest Ferdous.<br>
There are different classes of these fortunate persons. Some will be advancing and some retracing.&nbsp;<br>
Their rank will very according to the variance of their degree of knowledge of God. There are many&nbsp;<br>
stages of God's lovers as there are many steps of knowledge of God. There is no end of the depth of the&nbsp;<br>
ocean of Marfat and there is no such person who can cross that ocean. The divers according to their&nbsp;<br>
strength and the strength given to them by divine order can dive therein. There is no end of the path&nbsp;<br>
towards God. So there is no limit to the stages of those persons who walk in the path of God. He who&nbsp;<br>
has got better faith is also one of the fortunate people. His rank is lower than that of the fortunate&nbsp;<br>
Prophets. The highest rank of the fortunate men of blind faith is near the rank of the near ones. The&nbsp;<br>
man who gives up major sins, does the compulsory duties, stands upon the five pilars of Islam, utters&nbsp;<br>
Kalema Shahadat by tongue and heart, performs pilgrimage, gets this rank. He who comitted major sins,&nbsp;<br>
and neglected to do other compulsry duties but made sincere repentance before his death, will live with&nbsp;<br>
that peson who has not commited these sins. A washed cloth is like the cloth which' has got no dirt&nbsp;<br>
from the beginning. If he dies before repentance,<br>
his time of death will be fraught with dangers. Blind faith at the first tempest of slight doubt is&nbsp;<br>
shaken at the root. He who is wise with deep inisght keeps himself away from this danager at the time&nbsp;<br>
of death.<br>
<br>
He who continues to commit sins for as many days as he likes will get punishment therefore for&nbsp;<br>
proportionate days. He who does heinous sins will get severe punishment. He who does different kinds of&nbsp;<br>
sins will get different kinds of punishment, he will not come near the rank of the fortunate ones.&nbsp;<br>
Those who are gnostics with deep insight will live in the highest Paradise. There is in Hadis-He who&nbsp;<br>
will be taken last out of Hell will be given space ten times of this world. If the area of this world&nbsp;<br>
is one thousand miles, don't think he will be given space ten times of one thousand miles. This is like&nbsp;<br>
the saying of the man : I have given one who has taken my one camel ten camels. This means that if the&nbsp;<br>
price of a camel is ten dinars, he was given hundred dinars. The Prophet said : Paradise is situated in&nbsp;<br>
heaven. It appears that heaven is in this world. So how can Paradise situated in the world be ten times&nbsp;<br>
of this world? It should not be taken literally.<br>
CAUSES OF DISASTERS ON RELIGIONS PEOPLE<br>
<br>
The Prophet said: Be kind on three persons- (1) a learned man among the illiterate (2) a rich man among&nbsp;<br>
the poor and (3) an honourable man among the dishonourable persons. For this reason the Prophets are&nbsp;<br>
the recipients of kindness among his followers as they suffered owing to the short intelligence of&nbsp;<br>
their followers. Those are tests from God for their examination and come from God according to destiny.&nbsp;<br>
For this reason, the Prophet said : Disasters fell upon the Prophets, then on the friends of God and&nbsp;<br>
then on the religious persons like them. Disaster came upon the Prophet Ayub so also on Noah as he was&nbsp;<br>
tested for a group of people. Whenever the harsh word of a person gave the Prophet sorrow, he used to&nbsp;<br>
say : God showed mercy on my brother Moses who had to suffer much more hardship than this, but he&nbsp;<br>
remained patient. When the Prophets were not secure from the enmity of the oppositionsts and when the&nbsp;<br>
friends of God and the learned were not save from the fools, the friends of God are not free from&nbsp;<br>
dangers and difficulties. They are also tested by trials. They are driven out of towns and cities. They&nbsp;<br>
are blamed before<br>
32	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
<br>
the ruling powers and some men attribute to them infidetlity. The followers of Ma'aifat are known to&nbsp;<br>
the illiterate as fools.<br>
When you have become aware, of the truth of this subtle matter, believe then in the following words of&nbsp;<br>
the Prophet : The man who will come out last of all from Hell will get space ten times of the world. Be&nbsp;<br>
careful of believing only what your external sense organs can catch. If you only believe that, you will&nbsp;<br>
be an ass with two legs as you have got five senses and an ass also has got five senses. The Latifa or&nbsp;<br>
the subtle matter for which you are distinguished from an ass was presented to the heavens, earth and&nbsp;<br>
mountains but they refused to accept in and they were afraid of it. It is not of the material world and&nbsp;<br>
is outside the world governed by five senses. It is included within the spiritual world in which no&nbsp;<br>
lower animal can enter. He who neglects this valuable thing and keeps it as useless, ruins himself. So&nbsp;<br>
don't include yourself within those who forget God. He who does not know except the knowledge gained by&nbsp;<br>
five senses, forgets God as God is not to be known only by the five senses and God makes one forgetful&nbsp;<br>
of his soul who forgets God. He misuses the trust placed in him by God. He is worst than a beast, as a&nbsp;<br>
heart gets salvation after its death but the trust in him after his death will be returned to him.<br>
Nobody except a believer in the unity of God, will come out of Hell. By unity of God, I don't mean only&nbsp;<br>
utterance of &quot;There is no deity but God&quot; as tongue is of this material world and it will not get&nbsp;<br>
benefit except in this material world. The essence of Tauhid is within mind. What is known to be true&nbsp;<br>
will do benefit. Tauhid becomes perfect when it is known that nothing happens except by the command of&nbsp;<br>
God. Its sign is not to get angry with any person, as the cause of an actions is nobody but God.'So&nbsp;<br>
Tauhid is divided into different classes. There are persons whose Tauhid is firm like a rock. There are&nbsp;<br>
persons whose Tauhid is like the weight of a seed. They will nevertheless be taken out of Hell. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said : He who has got faith to the weight of a seed will be taken out of Hell.<br>
Most persons believing in Tauhid will go to Hell on account of their oppression on the people. A man&nbsp;<br>
may have mountain<br>
--like virtues but the oppressed people will stand before him. He destroyed the honour of some persons,&nbsp;<br>
misappropriated money of others, beat and assaulted others and backbited others. They<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	33<br>
will be given compensation from his virtues. When his virtues will end the angels will say : 0 Lord,&nbsp;<br>
this man has finished his virtues but there are other claimants. God will say : Add their sins with his&nbsp;<br>
sins and throw him into Hell. So he will enter Hell for the sins of others and the oppressed persons&nbsp;<br>
will get the virtues of the oppressors and will go to Paradise. It is related that one of the friends&nbsp;<br>
of Ibn Jala backbited him. When his friends sought his pardon, he said : I will not forgive him. There&nbsp;<br>
is no virtue in my record of deeds like his virtues. How can I efface it. He also said : Backbiting is&nbsp;<br>
a sin for my friend, but a virtue for me. I wish to embellish my record of deeds therewith.<br>
<br>
A physician thinks that a certain patient will die and no medicine will bring his cure. He thinks of&nbsp;<br>
another patient who will be cured. But it is seen that the former patient has recovered and the latter&nbsp;<br>
has died. This is the mystery of God and outside the scope of the knowledge of man. The salvation and&nbsp;<br>
success in the next world is just like that. They have got secret causes outside human knowledge. For&nbsp;<br>
this reason, we should forgive the guilty and not express anger on the virtuous. God says : God does&nbsp;<br>
dot opress anybody-21 Q. 47. He says: God does not oppress anybody to the extent even of an atom. He&nbsp;<br>
says : Man does not earq anything except by his efforts. His efforts will be considered-5S: 38. He says&nbsp;<br>
: Everybody is responsible for his action-6: 115. He says : when they were misguided, He closed their&nbsp;<br>
minds. He says : When they changed their conditions, God changed their condition. God says : God does&nbsp;<br>
not change the condition of a people till they change their own condition. These verses are clear to&nbsp;<br>
those who are adapt in the knowledge of soul just as a person sees anything with his eyes. Eyes in some&nbsp;<br>
cases commit mistakes, as they see near what lies distant and see little what is big. But the eye of&nbsp;<br>
heart or soul cannot commit mistake. To this effect, the Quran says : The heart has not taken as false&nbsp;<br>
what it has seen-53: 11.<br>
Person who get salvation-Salvation means security without fourtune or success. Those who got salvation&nbsp;<br>
did not do divine service and they did not get reward although they were secure of punishment. They are&nbsp;<br>
like boys among the infidels or deranged of brain. They are like those persons who did not receive&nbsp;<br>
invitation to accept Islam and lived in unknown places. They have no knowledge of God and no actions of&nbsp;<br>
religion. They have<br>
34<br>
got such sin as can keep them away from God. They are neither the inmates or Paradise nor of Hell. They&nbsp;<br>
will remain in a place between Paradise and Hell called A'raf or elevated place.<br>
Rewarded persons-They are not blind believers but are cognisant of God with deep insight. They are the&nbsp;<br>
near ones and will get rewards beyond description. God says : Nobody knows what consoling rewards to&nbsp;<br>
the eyes are reserved for them. The Prophet said that God says : I have prepared for My righteous&nbsp;<br>
servants such reward as no eyes has seen, no ear has heard and no heart of a man has conceived.' The&nbsp;<br>
matter of enquiry of the Arefs or gnostics is to get that condition which no other man in the world can&nbsp;<br>
appreciate. They don't want palaces, beauriful dansels, milk, honey, wine, ornaments of paradise but&nbsp;<br>
they desire for Divine sight the less of which they will not be satisfied. This is the end of fortune&nbsp;<br>
and taste. Hazrat Rabia was asked : What is desirable in Paradise ? She said : To get Neighbour and&nbsp;<br>
then a house. These persons are engrossed in the love of the Master of the house and not of its&nbsp;<br>
embellishments. This condition is called Fana fillah.<br>
WHEN A MINOR SIN TURNED INTO A MAJOR SIN?<br>
(1) The first cause is that any minor sin if done repeatedly turns into a major sin. It is therefore&nbsp;<br>
said : If a minor sin is committed repeatedly, it does not remain a minor sin. If a major sin is&nbsp;<br>
committed and then there is repentance for it, it does not remain a major sin. In short, if a person&nbsp;<br>
commits a major sin and then refrains from it and does not do it again, it is expected to be forgiven&nbsp;<br>
more than a minor sin which he commits repeatedly. For instance, if water falls repeatedly on a stone,&nbsp;<br>
there falls a sign therein but if once only water is flown on it there will be no sign thereon. For&nbsp;<br>
this reason the Prophet, said : A good deed though trifling is good if done always. Anything small, if&nbsp;<br>
done repeatedly, brings good, and anything great, if not done always, is less beneficial to the&nbsp;<br>
progress of soul and its purity. Similarly a minor sin done repetadely turns into a major sin and its&nbsp;<br>
influence to blacken a soul is great. A great -sinner first of all commits minor sins apd then jumps&nbsp;<br>
into a major<br>
sin. A fornicator rarely commits fornication without doing some<br>
deeds of love. A person rarely kills a man without first cherishing<br>
hatred and enmity for him. So before every major sin, minor sins are<br>
committed. If minor sins are , committed throughout life, they<br>
c?nnot be expected to be forgiven, but if a major sin is committed<br>
suddenly, itis expected to be forgiven.<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	35<br>
<br>
(2) The second cause is to belittle sin. When a person thinks a sin great, he humbles himself before&nbsp;<br>
the Merciful. When he humbles himself, he becomes great. The influence of sin then does not fall in his&nbsp;<br>
heart to a great extent. If a sin is thought as insignificant, it is understood that the sin has&nbsp;<br>
cemented love with the heart and for this reason its influence on heart is great. Hadis : A beliver&nbsp;<br>
considers a sin hanging like a rock on his head, while a hypocrite considers a sin trifling like a bee&nbsp;<br>
which passes over his nose.' A beliver takes sin as great and think also a minor sin as great. God sent&nbsp;<br>
revelation to a certain Prophet : Don't see the trifling nature of a present but look to the nobility&nbsp;<br>
of the giver of the present. Don't think sin as small but look whom you are opposing by this sin. An&nbsp;<br>
Aref said from this angle of vision : There is no minor sin. Every opposition to God is a great sin. ;A&nbsp;<br>
certain companion said to his successors : You commit such sins which are thinner than your eye-lash&nbsp;<br>
but we regarded them as causes of ruin at the time of the Prophet. The companions regarded the minor&nbsp;<br>
sins as great. For this reason, the ignorant people do not think a minor fault as sin, while the&nbsp;<br>
learned consider it as a major sin. This matter bypasses a blind man but not one having eyes.<br>
(3) Third cause to get pleasure in sin. If pleasure is, found by committing a minor sin, it turns into&nbsp;<br>
a major sin. Whenever the pleasure of a minor sin is great, it turns into a major sin. Even there are&nbsp;<br>
persons who take pride after commission of such minor sins. For instance, one may say : Have you seen&nbsp;<br>
how I have injured his honour and howl have madehimafool?<br>
(4) The fourth cause is to think a minor sin as trifling as it met with no punishment. God has kept his&nbsp;<br>
sin secret and as such IMP keeps patience at it and gives him time to repent and to seek forgiveness,&nbsp;<br>
if the sinner neglects it, the minor sin turns into a major sin. The sinner is unaware that God gives&nbsp;<br>
him time disliking it. He thinks that as the sin does not meet with punishment, God was kind to him.&nbsp;<br>
This is not kindness of God, but it is His plan and trick and nobody can be secure of his sin. God says&nbsp;<br>
: They think that God may give punishment for what they say. Hell is sufficient for them. They will&nbsp;<br>
enter therein. How bad in this place of entry!<br>
(5) The fifth cause is that if a sin is disclosed, it turns into a major sin. If a man commits a sin&nbsp;<br>
and then discloses it or if he commits it in presence of others, he lifts the screen which God has&nbsp;<br>
thrown upon his sin and gives encouragement to others by his<br>
TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
36	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
<br>
sin. If others hear of his sins or see his actions of sins, these are also acts of sin. It appears from&nbsp;<br>
this that one sin creaters another sin and hence his guilt increases. There is in Hadis that the sins&nbsp;<br>
of all, except those who disclose their sins, deserve to be forgiven. A certain sage said : Don't&nbsp;<br>
commit sin. If by chance a sin is committed, don't commit another sin by giving encouragement to&nbsp;<br>
others. For this reason, God says : The hypocrite male and hypocrite female are friends to each other.&nbsp;<br>
They enjoin evil deeds and prohibit good deeds.<br>
<br>
(6) Sixth cause. The minor sin of a learned man turns in to a major sin. The reason is that the people&nbsp;<br>
follow the learned men. If any one of them commits a minor sin, the people also commit it as they&nbsp;<br>
follow him. If a learned man puts on silk dress or a gold ring, enjoys the doubtful properties of&nbsp;<br>
others, frequently g es to the darbar of a ruling authority, learns such a learning with which he&nbsp;<br>
wishes to arpe with others and seeks name and fame, these will turn into major sins if the people&nbsp;<br>
follow his actions. Even after his death, these evils continue in the world. Thanks to the learned man&nbsp;<br>
with whose death there is the end of his sin. There is in Hadis that whose introduces a bad custom, his&nbsp;<br>
sin ahd the sins of those who follow him devolve on him and his sins will never be reduced a little.&nbsp;<br>
God says : We shall record what they sent in advance and their signs. The meaning of, these signs is&nbsp;<br>
what remains of their actions after they are done and what -remains with its doer. Hazrat Ibn Abbas&nbsp;<br>
said : Woe to the learned man wno follows in his bad actions. I f he slips he repents but the people&nbsp;<br>
hear it and travel therewith in the country. A certain sage said : The slip of a learned man is like&nbsp;<br>
the break of a boat which capsizes with those who are on board of it.<br>
<br>
There is in a book of Banu Israil that a learned man misguided the people by his innovation. Then he&nbsp;<br>
repented and began to do goods deeds for a pretty long time. God revealed to His Prophet to tell him :&nbsp;<br>
If his sin would have been confined between him and Me, I would have forgiven him. How can I forgive&nbsp;<br>
one who misguides My servants ? I will throw him into Hell along with them. It appears from this that&nbsp;<br>
the affairs of the learned men are very serious.. They have got the duty of giving up sin and the duty&nbsp;<br>
of concealing It. As their sins are increased, their virtues also.are increased, as the people follow&nbsp;<br>
them in both their actions. If a learned man gives up the enjoyments of the world<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	37<br>
and attachment of the world and remains satisfied with little food and drink and old clothes, gets&nbsp;<br>
virtues like the virtues of those who followed him in these affairs. If he does the contrary and&nbsp;<br>
remains attached to the enjoyments of the world only, he becomes the cause of these evils.<br>
CONDITION OF TAUBA<br>
Tauba means repentance and determination for not doing the same again. Knowledge, repentance and&nbsp;<br>
determination are the conditions of Tauba. Repentance is the name of grief that comes as a result of&nbsp;<br>
loss of a dear thing. It has got many signs-pangs of mind and sorrow, shedding tears, weeping for a&nbsp;<br>
long time, living in cares and anxieties. What thing other than sins shows path to punishment ? Whoelse&nbsp;<br>
except God and His Apostle is the giver of true news ? There is in Hadis: Live with those who repent,&nbsp;<br>
as their minds are very soft.' There is a story of Banu Israil that a man committed a sin and then&nbsp;<br>
repented and remained engaged for many years in divine service but still his repentance was not&nbsp;<br>
accepted. The Prophet of the time was asked about the acceptance of his Tauba and God revealed to him :&nbsp;<br>
By My honour and glory, if the inmates of heaven and earth make intercession for him, I will not except&nbsp;<br>
his repentance, as the pleasure of sin still lies within his mind.<br>
Question: Mind naturally turns towards sinful acts. Why should there be taste of bitterness ?<br>
Answer: Some one drinks honey mixed with poison and gets these at the time of drinking, but thereafter&nbsp;<br>
he suffers for long after he falls ill, his hairs fall down and his limbs get swollen. if thereafter&nbsp;<br>
honey mixed with poison is given to him although he is then hungry and has got a great desire to enjoy&nbsp;<br>
sweet things, he will hesitate in drinking that honey. The bitterness of sin is like that to a&nbsp;<br>
repentant. So the pleasure of every sin is like the taste of honey but there is poison in it. Without&nbsp;<br>
this belief, Tauba can not be sincere. When this belief becomes difficult his repentance can not be&nbsp;<br>
sincere. Believe that there is a ruinous poison in every sin as you believe firmly that poison is&nbsp;<br>
ruinous.<br>
DETERMINATION OR FIRM WILL: The firm will which comes out of repentance is the will of inquiry. It has&nbsp;<br>
got connection with the present, future and past, Regarding its connection with the present, it gives&nbsp;<br>
advice to one to give up<br>
<br>
38<br>
TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	39<br>
every sin, every prohibited thing and to do all compulsory duties. With regard to its connection with&nbsp;<br>
the past, it enquires into omission of duties. With regard to its connection with future, it advices&nbsp;<br>
him to take care, so that there should be no further ommission of compulsory duties and doing divine&nbsp;<br>
service always and giving up sins upto death.<br>
The condition of sincere Tauba is that one should prepare for<br>
correction of past misdeeds. From the day of omission of semen<br>
upto the present time, take account of all ommissions an<br>
commissions and rectify these, observe the omitted prayers, pay<br>
the dues of Zakat and do other duties like fasting and pilgrimage. If you could not have fasted in&nbsp;<br>
Ramzan, you should keep them. If you had means of going to pilgrimage and you now had not done ii, do&nbsp;<br>
it and if you can not do it now owing to poverty, you should try to do it, or else you will be a&nbsp;<br>
sinner. If you die before making pilgrimage, you will die as a sinner as the Proph et said : He who&nbsp;<br>
dies without making pilgrimage may die if he wishes as a Christian, or if he wishes as a Jew. Regarding&nbsp;<br>
other sins, enquire about those committed upto date by your ears, eyes, tongue, stomach, hands, feet&nbsp;<br>
and sexual organ and try to repent for them and remove the wrong's you have done to others by the&nbsp;<br>
commission of sins. Repent sincerely for the sins for breach of duties towards God. Take account of all&nbsp;<br>
the sins from maturity upto date and do one good dead in place of one sin. The Prophet said : &quot;Fear God&nbsp;<br>
wherever you remain and do a good deed after an evil deed and it will effect it. God says : Good deeds&nbsp;<br>
remove the bad ones-11:114 Your object will be to give up every sin as harmful like poison.<br>
Sin is darkness and virtue is light. As darkness can be removed by light, so also sin can be removed by&nbsp;<br>
virtue. This is the easy way for effacing sins, as a thing can be destroyed by its opposite thing. Love&nbsp;<br>
for the world is the root of all sins. The Prophet said : There are some kinds of sins which are&nbsp;<br>
expiated only by cares and anxieties. The Prophet also said : When the sins of a man become' too much&nbsp;<br>
and there remains no such good deed which can expiate his sins, God admits in his mind cares and&nbsp;<br>
anxiteties which expiate his sins.<br>
Question: Man's cares and anxieties generally arise in connection with his properties, children, name&nbsp;<br>
and fame. Can they be expiation of sins ?<br>
Answer: To love the above things are sins but if he is deprived of those things, his sins are expiated.&nbsp;<br>
It is narrated that Gabriel once came to Joseph in his prison. The latter asked him : How far have you&nbsp;<br>
burdened my old father with sorrows and anxieties ? Gabriel said : He has been given sorrows to the&nbsp;<br>
extent of grief of a mother who lost one hundred sons. Joseph said What rank will he get near God&nbsp;<br>
therefore ? Gabriel said : &quot;The rank of one hundred martyrs&quot;.<br>
BREACH OF DUTIES TOWARDS THE PEOPLE : In this matter also you have some duty towards God as He&nbsp;<br>
prohibited the people from oppression. So for this breach of duty he should be penitently sincere to&nbsp;<br>
Him and promise not to do it again in future. Be kind to a man whom you have oppressed. Return to him&nbsp;<br>
his properties, if you have taken them unjusty. Praise one whose honours you have destroyed. Speak good&nbsp;<br>
of your neighbour whom you have backbited. These will not save you, unless you refrain from doing wrong&nbsp;<br>
to others. If you have done harm to the life or honour of a man or given trouble to his heart, you have&nbsp;<br>
oppressed him. If you have killed a person out of mistake, give blood money to his heirs.<br>
It is reported that Maez-bin-Malek came to the Prophet and said &quot;0 Messenger of God, I have committed&nbsp;<br>
fromiction and I have oppressed my soul. So purify me. This is my wish.&quot; The Prophet turned him back.&nbsp;<br>
On the following day, he came again to the Prophet and said as above. He turned him back for the second&nbsp;<br>
time. When he said this for the third and fourth time, he passed orders for his punishment. A pit was&nbsp;<br>
dug for him and he was put therein and stoned to death. There were two parties over this affairs. Some&nbsp;<br>
said &quot;He has been ruined&quot;. Some said &quot;This is no other 'sincere Tauba like his.&quot; The Prophet said &quot; He&nbsp;<br>
has repented in such a way that if it would have been divided among the people, it would have been&nbsp;<br>
sufficient for them.&quot;<br>
On another day, one Gamedi woman came to the Prophet and said &quot;I have committed fornication, purify&nbsp;<br>
me.&quot; The Prophet turned her away. On the following day she came again to the Prophet and said &quot;0&nbsp;<br>
messenger of God, why, did you turn me away ? You have thought that as you have turned away Maez, you&nbsp;<br>
will also turn me away. By God, I have conceived.&quot; The Prophet said &quot;Go away till you give birth to a&nbsp;<br>
child.&quot; Immediately after the child was born, she came to the Prophet<br>
40	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
<br>
with the child putting on a torn cloth and said &quot;My child is born.&quot; The Prophet said &quot;Go and suckle it,&nbsp;<br>
till it comes to an end.' When<br>
the suckling ended, she came to the Prophet with the boy in<br>
whose hand there was a piece of bread. She said &quot;0 Prophet of<br>
God, I have finished suckling and now he has been taking food.&quot; The Prophet then handed over the boy to&nbsp;<br>
a Muslim. A pit was dug upto her breast and the Prophet then passed order to stone her to death. Hazrat&nbsp;<br>
Khalid-bin-Walid threw a piece of stone on her head which gave out a streak of blood which fell on his&nbsp;<br>
face and he was rebuking her. The Prophet heard it, rebuked him for it and said &quot;Stop 0 Khalid, One in&nbsp;<br>
whose hand there lies my life, she has made such a Tauba that if a collector of Zakat in excess of&nbsp;<br>
limit makes such Tauba, his Tauba will be accepted. She was then buried after funeral prayer. If the&nbsp;<br>
money of somebody was taken by force or there was a breach of trust or the wages of a labourer were not&nbsp;<br>
paid or paid less, it is incumbent to gather information of these things from the time of maturity upto&nbsp;<br>
date and to pay their just dues.<br>
<br>
REGARDING PROPERTY: If the owner is known. It is incumbent on him to return it to him. If the owner is&nbsp;<br>
not known it should be given in charity. If you have given trouble to the mind of anybody. Seek pardon&nbsp;<br>
from him. The Prophet said &quot;One of your predecessors killed 99 persons and asked: Who is the wisest man&nbsp;<br>
in the world? When a saint was mentioned to him, he came to the saint and said &quot;0 saint, I have killed&nbsp;<br>
99 persons. Will my Tauba be accepted?&quot; The saint said &quot;Your Tauba will not be accepted.&quot; Hearing this,&nbsp;<br>
he killed the saint and filled up his number of murders to one hundred. Then he enquired of the&nbsp;<br>
greatest learned man in the world. When his name was mentioned, he came to him and asked him: I have&nbsp;<br>
killed one hundred persons. Will my Tauba be accepted? He said &quot;Yes, your Tauba will be accepted. What&nbsp;<br>
is the reason of its not being accepted? There you will find some persons engaged in divine service. Do&nbsp;<br>
divine service along with them and don't come to your native place as the land is not good.&quot; When the&nbsp;<br>
man was half way to that land he breathed his last.<br>
<br>
The angel of mercy and the angel of punishment quarreled with each other regarding his case. The angel&nbsp;<br>
of mercy said &quot;He has repented and turned his face towards God&quot;. The angel of punishment said &quot;He did&nbsp;<br>
never do any good deed.&quot; When<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	41<br>
another angel in the form of a man came there, they took him as an umpire to settle the matter. He said&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Fix the distance between the two paths and he will get the path which is nearest to him.&quot; They&nbsp;<br>
measured the two paths and found that he crossed the path of repentance more than the other path. Then&nbsp;<br>
the angel of mercy took him with him and he was forgiven.<br>
<br>
DETERMINATION IN FUTURE<br>
Firm determination shall have to be taken, so that sins are not committed in future. Hold firm&nbsp;<br>
connection with God, take such firm determination; that no such sin is committed in future. Be like&nbsp;<br>
such a patient who knows in his illness that the eating of fruits will do his harm 3Ind for that he&nbsp;<br>
takes such firm resolve that till he is cured he will not take fruits again. Till such firm resolve is&nbsp;<br>
made, there will be no Tauba. Your Tauba will not be perfect till you keep separate from your greed,&nbsp;<br>
keep silence, eat less and sleep less and take firm precautions in eating lawful things, as eating of&nbsp;<br>
unlawful things is the root of all sins. He who can not give up greed in foods and drinks, his eating&nbsp;<br>
of lawful things and giving up of doubtful things are not sufficient. A certain sage said &quot;If a man&nbsp;<br>
repents for his sins and keeps patience for seven years, he will not again come to that sin.&quot;<br>
Question: What is your opinion regarding (1) a person who forgets his sins and does not think of it and&nbsp;<br>
(2) a person who remembers his sin and does not forget it?<br>
Answer : One section of the learned men say that Tauba means keeping sins in front. Another section say&nbsp;<br>
that it means to forget sins. To us, these two opinions are both true according to circumstances. There&nbsp;<br>
are many ways to go to God, some near and some distant. To keep sins in front and to remember them is&nbsp;<br>
good for a beginner in the path of religion, as in case he forgets them, his repentance will not&nbsp;<br>
increase and for that his will to walk in they way to God will not be so strong. If he remembers his&nbsp;<br>
sins, his sorrows will increase and he will fear to commit them again. The above person is better than&nbsp;<br>
a careless person, but it is more injurious to a sojourner for religion as in the case of journey&nbsp;<br>
remembrance of sin is an impediment, Rather he should not deviate from the straight path of religion.&nbsp;<br>
In case sexual passion becomes strong, if the sin of fornication is remembered, it is injurious and to&nbsp;<br>
forget it is better. The Prophet said &quot;Be careful, I<br>
42	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	43<br>
commit no mistake, but I am thrown to a mistake, so that I may understand it&quot;. In another narration, I&nbsp;<br>
am made to forget in order'; to establish a way of life. The Prophet talked to men according to' their&nbsp;<br>
intelligence. When Hazrat Hasan took some dates in his mouth to eat, the Prophet said &quot;Kakh, Kakh&quot;&nbsp;<br>
meaning vomit it. He did not then understand the word &quot;Vomit the dates&quot; as he was then too young. So he&nbsp;<br>
made him to understand with the words of a child that it is unlawful. Similarly, if a person calls a&nbsp;<br>
bird or a beast with particular words, it responds to him and it does not respond to any other words.&nbsp;<br>
So be not indifferent to these words.<br>
<br>
1. Class of repentant : The repentants are of four classes. The first class are those who repent for&nbsp;<br>
sins that may be committed upto the end of their lives and those who repent for past sins and take care&nbsp;<br>
not to commit sins in future. As a result of habits, some evil thoughts may arise in his mind. For this&nbsp;<br>
one should stay on repentance, advance towards good deeds and give up evil ones. The name of this Tauba&nbsp;<br>
is Tauba Nasuha or sincere repentance. The mind of such a repentant is called Nafse Mutmainna or quiet&nbsp;<br>
mind. It returns to its Lord well pleased with Him and well pleasing Him-89: 26. The Prophet said with&nbsp;<br>
regard to these persons Mufarredun went in advance.&quot; They are desirous of God's remembrances. Zikr has&nbsp;<br>
pulled down from them their burdens. So they will come with light burdens on the Resurrection Day. It&nbsp;<br>
is seen that there is the burden of Zikr on them, but actually it is Zikr which has taken away their&nbsp;<br>
burden. They have different ranks. There are some repentants whose desires fall under the flow of&nbsp;<br>
divine knowledge and become quite. Another class of repentants can not save themselves from clash with&nbsp;<br>
their low desires and they take delay to turn them back with efforts. There are some persons who meet&nbsp;<br>
with death after repentance. Some person make Jihad with their passion after Tauba keep patience and&nbsp;<br>
remain upon Tauba. Their rank is highest as their good deeds destroy their evil deeds. A certain sage&nbsp;<br>
said : If a sinner commits a sin and restrains himself from it after getting opportunity of committing&nbsp;<br>
it again out of fear of God and keeps patience and controls his sexual desire, it expiates his sins.&nbsp;<br>
This condition is very difficult but its result is very good.<br>
<br>
2. The second class of repentants : Such a person after repentance keeps himself firm for some days,&nbsp;<br>
gives up major sins and does divine service, but he is not free from such sins owing to<br>
pressure of circumstances although he has got no such object. He does not have a firm will to do that&nbsp;<br>
sin but if he commits it, he becomes repentant and sorrowful. Then he resolves that he will not to do&nbsp;<br>
that sin but if he becomes repentant and sorrowful. Then he resolves that he will not do it again. The&nbsp;<br>
mind which has got such a state is called Nafse Lawwamah or self- accusing soul. This Tauba is less&nbsp;<br>
than that of the first class. Evil is mixed with the blood of man and he can hardly release himself&nbsp;<br>
from it. God says : God is openhanded in pardoning those who give up major sins and indecencies except&nbsp;<br>
passing thoughts of sins. An evil thought suddenly crops up in mind along with the minor sins. He had&nbsp;<br>
no previous thought about it. So this kind of evil thought is pardonable. God says : When they do&nbsp;<br>
indecent acts or oppress themselves and then remember God and seek forgiveness for their sins. So it&nbsp;<br>
seen that God praised them for their repentance inspite of oppression on their soul. For this rank, the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said<br>
Those who repent after commission of a sin are the best among you. In another narration, a believer is&nbsp;<br>
like a stalk of corn. Sometime its head rises up straight and sometimes bends down The Prophet said: A&nbsp;<br>
believer is not free from sin.<br>
<br>
This shown that Tauba is not called for these sins. Such a guilty person does not reach the stage of a&nbsp;<br>
sinner. The Prophet said : Every son of Adam is a sinner. Among the sinners, those persons are good who&nbsp;<br>
repent and seek forgiveness. He said also &quot;A believer may commit many sins but is busy in repentance.&nbsp;<br>
God says &quot;They will be given double rewards on account of their patience, and thereby remove the evils&nbsp;<br>
by good deeds.&quot; God says in this verse that they do good deeds after commission of a sin. He did not&nbsp;<br>
say that they do not commit sins.<br>
<br>
3. The third class of repentants : Such a repentants keeps himself alright for some time and then his&nbsp;<br>
passion becomes strong for commission of sins. As a result, he advances towards sin, being unable to&nbsp;<br>
control his passion. Inspite of this he does divine service always, but can not give up one or two&nbsp;<br>
sinful actions. He loves that it would have been better if God gave him power to control them. After&nbsp;<br>
the sin, he becomes repentant and says &quot;Alas, had I not done it&quot; This soul as called Nafse Mosawaalah&nbsp;<br>
or questioning soul. God says regarding these persons &quot;And about others, they recognize their sins and&nbsp;<br>
they mix good works with them and others mix evil deeds.&quot; These<br>
44<br>
TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
<br>
persons continue to do good deeds and expect forgiveness for<br>
their sins and faults. Many a time such a man dies before<br>
repentance. The region of the next world and its enjoyment falls<br>
on that person whose soul is saved and who purifies his soul for a<br>
long time as decreed by God in his destiny. For this reason, God<br>
says : By the oath of soul and what it purifies, He informs it of its<br>
evil deeds and its God-fear. He gets salvation, who purifies it<br>
and he is ruined who pollutes it-91: 7. The Prophet said : A man<br>
may continue to do good deeds upto seventy years. Even the people then say that he is one of the&nbsp;<br>
inmates of Paradise. There is then the distance of half a cubit between him and Paradise. Then suddenly&nbsp;<br>
his fate comes forward and he begins to work the deeds of the inmates of Hell and then he enters Hell.&nbsp;<br>
So there is the fear of death before his Tauba. Man's every breath may be his last breath and death may&nbsp;<br>
be linked up with that breath.<br>
4. Fourth class of repentants : These persons repent and remain in that condition for some days and&nbsp;<br>
then again return to sin. They feel no sorrow for their sins and do not mind to repent. These persons&nbsp;<br>
are included within the habitual sinners. Such a soul is called Nafse Ammarah or a soul prone the&nbsp;<br>
evils. Such a soul runs towards evils after returning from good deeds. There is fear for such a man in&nbsp;<br>
the end. If he dies upon good and upon Tauba, he will await his release from hell although it will&nbsp;<br>
occur after some time. So to seek forgiveness by divine service is like acquiring education by efforts&nbsp;<br>
arid like seeking wealth by trade by crossing the big seas. All the people, except the learned are&nbsp;<br>
deprived of fortune. All the learned men except those who do good deeds are deprive of fortune. All the&nbsp;<br>
doers of goods deeds are deprived of fortune except those who sincerely do good for the sake of God.&nbsp;<br>
They also remain in anxieties. Those who hope for God's forgiveness without any good deed at their&nbsp;<br>
credit are fools, as God says &quot;There is nothing for man except what he strives for.&quot; The wealth of the&nbsp;<br>
world is short lived, still it is subject to hard labour. How can you expect rewards without hard&nbsp;<br>
labour and sincere efforts in the next world ?<br>
EXPLANATION OF VOLUNTARY AND<br>
INVOLUNTARY SINS<br>
If a man commits a sin, he has got two compulsory dutiesTauba or repentance, and then doing a good&nbsp;<br>
deed. A thing can be destroyed by its opposite, such as cold by heat. So a bad deed can<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	45<br>
be removed by a good deed done immediately after it. ;If the evil deed rises from mind, its expiation&nbsp;<br>
is to seek forgiveness with all the humility of a slave. Expiation by tongue is admission of evil and&nbsp;<br>
seeking forgiveness from God saying. '0 Lord I have done oppression to my soul and committed sin. So&nbsp;<br>
forgive my sins&quot;. Expiation by bodily limb is to pray, to give charity and to do divine services.<br>
<br>
It appears from the sayings of the sages that after the commission of sin, if eight good deeds are&nbsp;<br>
done, it may be forgiven. The actions of heart regarding expiation of sins are four-Tauba, to think of&nbsp;<br>
a good thing, to take precautions of sins and to fear punishment for sins and for that to expect&nbsp;<br>
forgiveness. The actions of limbs are four regarding expiation of sins - (1) To pray two rak'ats&nbsp;<br>
immediately after commission of a sin. (2) then to pray for forgiveness to God seventy times and to&nbsp;<br>
recite ( God is great with His praise ) one hundred times, (3) to give charity, and then (4) to keep&nbsp;<br>
fast. Some wise man said &quot;After sin, make ablution well and pray two rak'ats in a mosque.&quot; There is in&nbsp;<br>
a Hadis :'When you commit a sin, do a good deed immediately, pray secretly, if you do a sinful act&nbsp;<br>
secretly and pray openly if you do a sinful act openly. A certain sage said &quot;Sin committed at night is&nbsp;<br>
expiated by secret charity and sin committed at day time is expiated by open charity. There is in a&nbsp;<br>
Hadis : A man came to the Prophet and said I have committed every sort of sin with a woman except&nbsp;<br>
fornication. Give judgment against me according to the laws of God. The Prophet said : Have you not&nbsp;<br>
said the morning prayer with us ? He said &quot;Yes, I have prayed.&quot; The Prophet said &quot;Certainly good deeds&nbsp;<br>
remove evil ones.&quot; It appears from this that except fornication, any other act with a strange woman is&nbsp;<br>
a minor sin. The minor sins committed during five prayers are expiated by these prayers.<br>
<br>
Different stages of seeking forgiveness: Hazrat Sahal Tastari said &quot;It is necessary for a slave to&nbsp;<br>
approach his master in every condition. So it is better to return to the master in every matter. If he&nbsp;<br>
commits a sin he says : 0, Lord keep it a secret. When he finishes his sinful act, he says: 0, Lord.&nbsp;<br>
accept my repentance. When he repents, he says &quot;0 Lord, make me sinless&quot;. When he does an act, he says,&nbsp;<br>
0 Lord, accept this from me. Once a man asked him about such seeking of forgiveness as expiation of&nbsp;<br>
sins. He said &quot;The beginning of seeking forgiveness is Izlijabat,<br>
46	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
then Enabat and then Tauba. Izlijabat means seeking forgiveness<br>
by moving bodily limbs. Enabat means mental act of seeking forgiveness by sincere motive and good&nbsp;<br>
wishes. Tauba means to give up the people and to return to the Creator. After Tauba, he shall take&nbsp;<br>
recourse to silence and remain upon Tauba. The object of Tauba is to get two benefits-firstly, to&nbsp;<br>
expiate for sins in such a way that he can be classed with the man who did not commit sin; secondly, to&nbsp;<br>
gain such a rank as he can be addressed as a friend.<br>
<br>
There are several steps for expiation of sins. Some steps efface the root of evils from its root. Some&nbsp;<br>
steps make the sin light. Expiation differs according to the rank of repentants. Don't thing a good&nbsp;<br>
think as insignificant even if it is every small. A certain foolish woman in order to ward off the&nbsp;<br>
troubles of weaving thread says &quot;I can prepare only one piece of thread in an hour. What will you do&nbsp;<br>
with one piece of thread ? Can a piece of cloth be made with one piece of thread only ?&quot; The foolish&nbsp;<br>
woman does not know that all the cloths in the world are woven with so many threads and the world&nbsp;<br>
inspite of its spaciousness, was created by so many atoms. In short, to seek forgiveness and<br>
1<br>
to express humility before God is such a virtuous act which will never be destroyed.<br>
A certain disciple asked his Pir Abu Osman Magribi &quot;Sometimes my tongue utters Zikr and Quran reading,&nbsp;<br>
but my mind remains then absent. He said : Be grateful to God that He kept one of your organs in a&nbsp;<br>
virtuous act, habituates you in Zikr, and has not engaged you in evil deeds.&quot; The saying of the sage is&nbsp;<br>
indeed true. If you can habituate your bodily limbs in good works till it turns into habit, you will&nbsp;<br>
removing great many sins. If a man has got the habit of uttering &quot;Astagferullah&quot; I seek forgiveness of&nbsp;<br>
God he will at once say &quot;Astagferullah.&quot; if he hears a false talk from anybody. For this reason, God&nbsp;<br>
says &quot;God does not spoil the records of the doers of good.&quot; God says &quot;If you do a good deed. He will&nbsp;<br>
increase it and give you profuse rewards from Him.&quot; Hazrat Jafar Sadeq said &quot;God kept three things&nbsp;<br>
secret in three things-(I) His pleasure in divine service, so don't neglect anything of divine service,&nbsp;<br>
perhaps there lies His pleasure therein. (2) His wrath in sins. So don't neglect a trifling thing, as&nbsp;<br>
there may be His wrath there in. (3) Hissecret friendship amongst His servants, so don't disregard any&nbsp;<br>
of them, as he may be a friend of God. He added another thing -His hidden answer in his<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES 47 invocation. So don't give up invocation, often a reply may&nbsp;<br>
come therein.<br>
MEDICINE FOR UNWILLINGNESS TO REPENT<br>
There are two classes of men : On class of young men have got no attraction towards evils. They grow on&nbsp;<br>
good things and give up evils. The Prophet said : Your Lord is pleased with that young man who has got&nbsp;<br>
no attraction towards evils, such a man is rare, but most honoured. The second class of men are not&nbsp;<br>
free from attraction towards evils. They are subdivided into two-those who repent after commission of&nbsp;<br>
sins and those who are engaged in sins all the time. Tauba cannot be earned without curable medicine.&nbsp;<br>
He who cannot diagnose a disease cannot know its medicine. Every disease has got its primary or root&nbsp;<br>
cause and to remove that case is its medicine. Without an opposite thing, it cannot be removed. Greed&nbsp;<br>
and negligence are the causes of engagement in sins. Carefulness is opposite to negligence and patience&nbsp;<br>
is opposite to greed. Negligence is the root of all evils. God says : They are negligent, there is no&nbsp;<br>
doubt that they will be losers in the next world: The medicine of Tauba is the mixture of some&nbsp;<br>
ingredients-sweetness of knowledge and bitterness of patience. A mind affected with the disease of&nbsp;<br>
repeatedly committing sins should be treated with a mixture of knowledge and patience.<br>
Question : Is every knowledge profitable for removal of repeated sins ?<br>
Answer : There is expert knowledge about a special disease, just as the science of treatment is&nbsp;<br>
necessary for treatment of general diseases. A man of this type of disease must have faith in several&nbsp;<br>
subjects.<br>
(i) He must have faith that there are certain causes of disease and health. God has recorded their&nbsp;<br>
causes and given us freedom to select those causes. Firm faith grows out of it in the rootscience of&nbsp;<br>
medicine as he who has no faith in this science will not take to treatment and has got nothing but&nbsp;<br>
ruiq. Similarly repeated commission of sins cannot be removed without faith in the fundamental matters&nbsp;<br>
of religion. That is .this. There are causes of fortunes in the next world and those causes are&nbsp;<br>
virtues, and there are causes of misfortunes in the next world and those causes are sins. This is the&nbsp;<br>
faith in the basic principle of religion.<br>
48	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
<br>
(ii) The second subject is that a patient must have faith in a certain physician that he has got expert&nbsp;<br>
knowledge in a particular branch of medicine and special proficiency in the process of treatment.&nbsp;<br>
Similarly the sinner must have faith in the fact that the prophet is a true Prophet and all that he&nbsp;<br>
said are true without the slightest tinge of falsehood.<br>
<br>
(iii) The third subject is that as a patient must obey with attention and care the instructions of the&nbsp;<br>
physician regarding diet and other injurious things, so also one addicted to sin must hear the verses&nbsp;<br>
of the Quran and the sayings of the Prophet with attention or follow these instructions with fear of&nbsp;<br>
God. (iv) The fourth subject is that as a patient must have look to what the physician gives&nbsp;<br>
instructions, so also every man should pay attention to what a spiritual guide says, though he has not&nbsp;<br>
greed<br>
for everything and does not commit every kind of sin. Every<br>
believer has got a special sin. The learned men of religion know about these and give instructions&nbsp;<br>
accordingly. They must take the lessons of religion to the people according to their diseases. This&nbsp;<br>
world is the abode of patients or hospital, as there are only dead men under the earth and patients&nbsp;<br>
above the earth. The number of patients of heart diseases is more than that of the patients of bodily&nbsp;<br>
diseases. The learned spiritual men are the physicians of heart diseases and the kings are the&nbsp;<br>
care-takers of the hospitals. The patients which does not take the medicine of a learned man should be&nbsp;<br>
handed over to the king, so that he may cure him of this evil as a physician hands over a patient who&nbsp;<br>
does not observe the rules or who is mad.<br>
<br>
DISEASE OF SOUL : It is more severe than that of body. There are three causes for which disease of soul&nbsp;<br>
is more severe than the disease of body. The first cause is that the patient does not know that he is&nbsp;<br>
sick. The second cause is that the result of the disease of soul is not seen in the world as the&nbsp;<br>
disease of body is seen. That death is the result of bodily disease is seen and one does not like it.&nbsp;<br>
Death of soul is the ultimate result of sin. That is not seen in the world and for this reason hatred&nbsp;<br>
for sin is less. If however the sinner knows it even, you will see that he depends more upon God's&nbsp;<br>
mercy for cure of the disease of soul. He works very hard by giving up idleness for cure of the bodily&nbsp;<br>
disease but he does not work so much for cure of the disease of soul. The third cause is that no&nbsp;<br>
physician can diagnose this incurable<br>
CL<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	49<br>
disease. The learned men are the physicians and they are also attacked with the incurable diseases of&nbsp;<br>
the age and so they are baffled in their treatment. This disease is not openly seen as it exists in&nbsp;<br>
everybody. They teach such things to the people as increase their disease, as love of this world is&nbsp;<br>
their serious disease. This disease is found in the physicians themselves. They are said : You are&nbsp;<br>
talking about treatment but you yourselves have forgotten it. The people are going to destruction on&nbsp;<br>
account of the death of physicians as the physicians themselves are engaged in eating evil and&nbsp;<br>
injurious diets.<br>
Hope and fear are two medicines, but they are applicable to various diseases. He whose fear is strong&nbsp;<br>
has given up this world wholly and burdened himself with additional burdens and confined himself within&nbsp;<br>
narrow provision. To him the causes of hope are many while the causes of fear are few. He who&nbsp;<br>
repeatedly commits sins and is despaired of repentance for many sins inspite of his will for repentance&nbsp;<br>
should be treated with the cause of hope so that he may expect acceptance of his repentance. If he who&nbsp;<br>
is misguided and engaged in sins and still hopes for God's mercy, is like that person who is treated&nbsp;<br>
with honey inspite of his body being very heated. This is the way of the fools and the illiterate. ,<br>
THERE ARE FOUR MODES OF GIVING UP SINS<br>
(1) The first mode is to remind the verses of fear to the sinners and transgressors. The Prophet said :&nbsp;<br>
The sun does not rise and no darkness comes down without the two angels communicating with each other&nbsp;<br>
by four voices. One angel says How good it would have been if men were not created. Another says : How&nbsp;<br>
good it would have been if after creation of men they knew the cause of their creation. Again the first&nbsp;<br>
angel says : How good it would have been if after knowing the cause of creation of men they worked&nbsp;<br>
according to their knowledge. In another narration, how good it would have been if they discussed with&nbsp;<br>
one another about what they knew. Another angel says : How good it would have been if they repented for&nbsp;<br>
not doing what they knew. An earlier sage said : When a man commits a sin, the angel of the right side&nbsp;<br>
calls the angel of the left side : Don't write it for six hours with your pen. If he repents and seeks&nbsp;<br>
forgiveness, he does not write it. If he does not seek forgiveness, he writes it. Another 'ancient sage&nbsp;<br>
said. When a man commits a sin, the<br>
50<br>
ground underneath that place seeks permission to sink down with him under the abyss and the sky above&nbsp;<br>
his head seeks permission to fall upon him. Then God says to that ground and the sky : Keep yourself&nbsp;<br>
away from My servant and leave him, as you have not created him. If you had created him, you would have&nbsp;<br>
shown him mercy. Perchance he will repent to Me and I may accept his repentance. Perchance he will do&nbsp;<br>
good works in place of it and I will grant him reward. In the spirit of this, God says : God restrains&nbsp;<br>
the heavens and the earth to fall down. If they fall down, who is there besides Him to hold them back?<br>
<br>
There is tradition reported by Hazrat Omar: One who gives seal hangs down with the pillars of the&nbsp;<br>
Throne. When somebody tears off this hidden screen and considers an unlawful thing as lawful, God sends&nbsp;<br>
down a sealer to seal upon his soul. As a result what is with it becomes covered. There is a tradition&nbsp;<br>
reported by Muzahed: Soul is like the front of an open hand. When a man commits a sin, a finger is&nbsp;<br>
closed. This is the meaning of seal. Hazrat Hasan Basari said: There is a fixed limit between man and&nbsp;<br>
his Creator. When he reaches that limit, God Himself puts a seal on his soul. Thereafter, he finds no&nbsp;<br>
inclination to do good deeds.<br>
<br>
There are many traditions and wise sayings about punishment of sin and praise of those who repent. If&nbsp;<br>
one inherits the Prophet, he should make much admonition therewith. The Prophet left no legacy but left&nbsp;<br>
only learning and wisdom. The more he gets learning therefrom the more legacy he gets from<br>
him.<br>
<br>
(2) Second mode: To narrate the lives of the Prophets and of the saints and pious men and of the&nbsp;<br>
dangers and difficulties that fell on them on account of their sins are profitable for the souls of men&nbsp;<br>
and fruitful. It is also to be narrated how the Prophet Adam was punished for only one sin and how he&nbsp;<br>
was driven out of Paradise. It is narrated that when he ate the fruits of the forbidden tree, his dress&nbsp;<br>
flew away from his body and his private parts became exposed but his head-gear and cover of his face&nbsp;<br>
felt shame to go away from him.<br>
<br>
Then Gabiel came down and took his head gear and cover of his face. Then it was proclaimed from heaven:&nbsp;<br>
Go down from Me, as he who disoboyed Me is not worthy to remain with Me. Hazrat<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	51<br>
<br>
Adam looked towards Hawa and saw that she weeping. He said: This is the first sign of our disobedience&nbsp;<br>
to God.<br>
It was narrated that for forty days an idol was worshipped in the house of the Prophet Solaiman for&nbsp;<br>
which he was punished. In another narration, a woman sought justice from Solaiman in respect of a&nbsp;<br>
matter of her father. He promised to do justice but afterwards he did not do it. In another narration,&nbsp;<br>
the woman thought that Hazrat Solaiman would deliver judgement in favour of her father as she had some&nbsp;<br>
rank before Solaiman. For this sin, the reign of Solaiman was robbed of for forty days for which he&nbsp;<br>
became afraid. He fell into such disaster that he did not even get food when he was hungry. When he&nbsp;<br>
sought for food saying: Give me food, I am Solaiman, son of David, the people used to rebuke and beat&nbsp;<br>
him and drive him out. It was narrated that during this time when he wanted food from his wife, she&nbsp;<br>
spate on his face and drove him out. There is another narration that an old woman poured urine over his&nbsp;<br>
head from a pot. Then God took out his ring from the stomach of a fish and he put it on for forty days&nbsp;<br>
after his punishement. Thereafter birds came and sat upon his head and jinn, birds and beasts began to&nbsp;<br>
gather around him. Solaiman said: I will not rebuke you for harsh treatment with me before and will not&nbsp;<br>
praise you for your excuse become me at present. These affairs came from God and there was no other&nbsp;<br>
alterative.<br>
There is a story of Banu Israil that a man married a foreign woman in her country. He sent his slave to&nbsp;<br>
bring her home. On the way the slave felt sexual desire to cohabit with her but restrained himself with&nbsp;<br>
great difficulties. For his patience, God rewarded him with the office of prophet-hood over the&nbsp;<br>
children of Israil. It was narrated that Moses once asked Khizr. Why have God given you kno*ledge of&nbsp;<br>
the unseen? He said: For giving up sins in order to incur the pleasure of God.<br>
It is said that even wind traveled with Solaiman. He was once pleased with his dress and looked at it.&nbsp;<br>
Suddenly the wind threw him down and he said: I obeyed you till you obeyed God. It is narrated that God&nbsp;<br>
sent down revelation to Hazrat Eakub: Do you know why I have separated your son Eusuf from you? He&nbsp;<br>
said: I don't know. God said: The reason is that you said to your sons: When you remain indifferent, I&nbsp;<br>
fear lest tiger may devour him. Why did you fear for him an attack of tiger and did not<br>
TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
52	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
depend on Me? Why did you look at their heedlessness and did not hope My protection? Do you know why I&nbsp;<br>
returned him to you? Hazrat Eakub said: I don't know. He said: You relied on Me and said: Perchance God&nbsp;<br>
may return all of them to me. You said also: Go and search for Eusuf and his brother and be not&nbsp;<br>
dispaired. When Hazrat Yousuf said to his prisoner: Remind me to your master, God said: The devil made&nbsp;<br>
him forgetful of his Lord. For that he stayed prison for some years.<br>
Thus there are many stories. The Quran and Hadis did not narrate them only for the sake of stories but&nbsp;<br>
its object is&quot;to admonish and to disclose the secret meaning, so that you may know that even prophets&nbsp;<br>
were not free from these sins. So how can the other people get free from major sins? The prophets&nbsp;<br>
received punishment in this world for minor sins and it was not kept in abeyance for the next world.&nbsp;<br>
The unfortunate only are given time, so that their sins may increase, as the punishment of the&nbsp;<br>
hereafter is very severe and most fearful. These stories should be narrated to the sinners, so that&nbsp;<br>
they may adopt the modes of repentance.<br>
(3) Third mode: The sinners should be told that the punishment of sins is expected to be meted out in&nbsp;<br>
this world and that the basic cause of dangers and difficulties that befall on men is their sin. May&nbsp;<br>
people think the next worldly punishment as easy and this worldly punishment as severe. The reason is&nbsp;<br>
their ignorance about the next world. These people should be told repeatedly about the punishement of&nbsp;<br>
this world. They should be told that their livelihood may be curtailed on account of their sins, their&nbsp;<br>
honour may be marred and their enemies may increase. The Prophet said: When a man commits sins: he&nbsp;<br>
deprived of his liveli hood. Hazrat-Ibn-Masud said: I think that a man forgets his learning owing to&nbsp;<br>
his commission of sins. In this context, the Prophet said: Wisdom goes away from a man who commits sins&nbsp;<br>
and it never comes to him. An ancient sage said: It is not misfortune that a man's face becomes black&nbsp;<br>
and he meets with loss of property, but misfortune is that he gives up a sin but commits it again or a&nbsp;<br>
more heinous sin.<br>
There is a story of a certain Aref that he was walking in a muddy land raising up his wearing apparel&nbsp;<br>
for fear of slipping down. Then he slipped and he fell down. He wept and said: My slip has been like&nbsp;<br>
the slip of one who walks by the side of a sin for<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	53<br>
saving himself from the sin and then slips into a sin or two and then falls deeply therein. For this&nbsp;<br>
reason the saint Fazili said: Whatever turn of fortune and loss of friendship occur, it is only for&nbsp;<br>
your sin. A certain sage said. I will consider the oppression of rats as punishment of my sin. A&nbsp;<br>
certain Sufi of Syria said: I was looking at the beautiful face of a christian boy. At that time Ibn&nbsp;<br>
Jala Dameski was passing by that way. He caught hold of my hand and I was ashamed I said: 0 Abu&nbsp;<br>
Abdullah, glory to God. I was charmed with the uncommon beauty of this boy. I don't know the wisdom of&nbsp;<br>
God that He created this beautiful boy for Hell. He pressed my hand and said: You will see its&nbsp;<br>
punishment after a while. After 30 years, I saw its punishment.<br>
Abu Solaiman Darani said: Emission of semen in dream is a punishment. He said: Nobody misses a&nbsp;<br>
congregational prayer except for sins. There is in Hadis, God says: When a man puts his greed above his&nbsp;<br>
divine service, the lowest punishment is that I deprive him of the pleasure of invocation.<br>
Abu Amer Olman narrated a story to this effect: I stood up for prayer when I felt urge of sexual&nbsp;<br>
passion which continued long. I felt a strong urge for cohabitation with a boy. I fell down on the&nbsp;<br>
ground and my whole body became black. Then I concealed myself and did not come out for three days. I&nbsp;<br>
went to the public bath room and washed my body but it increased blackness. After three days, the blood&nbsp;<br>
of the body became clean. Then I went to Bagdad to meet Hazrat Junaid. I asked him about it. He said:&nbsp;<br>
Are you not ashamed that you have made your sexual passion strong after standing before God? Then God&nbsp;<br>
drove you out from His presence. Had I not prayed for you and repented on your behalf to God, you would&nbsp;<br>
have met with God with that color. He said: l wondered how he came to know of it, when I was atRekka&nbsp;<br>
and he was inBagdad.<br>
Dear readers, know that the face of soul of man becomes black if he commits sins. If he is not a&nbsp;<br>
virtuous man, his black color spreads over his face. If he is unfortunate, it remains on his soul which&nbsp;<br>
becomes black and becomes fit to be burnt by fire. The disaster of sin in the world is poverty, illness&nbsp;<br>
and other evils as seen in various traditions. If any disaster comes to any person, it is owing to his&nbsp;<br>
sin. He is deprived of good provision and his misfortune is doubled. If any grace reaches him, it is&nbsp;<br>
prolonged for him but he is deprived of expressing gratefulness, till he is<br>
54	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	55<br>
punished for ungratefulness. He who is virtuous, has blessing for divine service. He is then given&nbsp;<br>
grace of expressing gratefulness and his disaster is panacea for his sins and increases his rank.<br>
(4) Fourth mode: It is to state the prescribed sentences for the prescribed crimes, such as drinking&nbsp;<br>
wine, fornication, murder, slander and other sins. Give such advice to a person for which he is&nbsp;<br>
deserving of advice. If you give such advice to a person for which he is not deserving, you will be&nbsp;<br>
giving medicine to a person who does not require it. The learned man should begin treatment just like&nbsp;<br>
an experienced physician who sees first his patient's appearance. The Prophet was once asked: 0&nbsp;<br>
Messenger of God, give me advice but not more. He said: Don't be angry. Another person said: 0&nbsp;<br>
Messenger of God, give me advice. The Prophet said: Don't be disappointed at seeing what is in the&nbsp;<br>
possession of man. This is called freedom from want. Be careful of greed, as the meaning of greed is&nbsp;<br>
freedom from the worldly wants. Pray in such a manner that you are leaving the world for good. Be&nbsp;<br>
careful of what you take as an excuse.<br>
A. person said to Ibn Wase: Give me advice. He said, I advice you to be an angel in this world and the&nbsp;<br>
world next. He said: How shall I be able to become such? He said: Adopt renunciation in the world. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet sensed anger in the mind of the first questioner. So he prohibited him to get angry. He saw in&nbsp;<br>
the second than greed for wealth and long hope and advised him accordingly. Ibn Waes saw in the third&nbsp;<br>
person attachment towards the world and so he advised him accordingly. A man asked Hazrat Ma'az: Give&nbsp;<br>
advice. He said: be kind, I may then guarantee Paradise for you, He perceived in him by his foresight&nbsp;<br>
harsh conduct and hard heart. Once a man said to Ibrahim Ibn Adham: Give me advice. He said: Be careful&nbsp;<br>
of men and keep company of the virtuous people, as men are subjects of thoughts of men. Every man is&nbsp;<br>
not a real man. Real men passed away and there remain only ghosts. I don't consider them as men.<br>
Hazrat Muwayiah wrote a letter to Hazrat Ayesha: Give me advice, but not more. Hazrat Ayesha wrote:&nbsp;<br>
From Ayesha to Muwayiah. I heard from the Prophet who said: 'God makes one free from want of men who&nbsp;<br>
seeks pleasure of God by incurring the displeasure of men and He entrusts one to the people who incurs&nbsp;<br>
displeasure of God by pleasing the people. Salam to you.' Now look to the wisdom of Hazrat.&amp;yesha, how&nbsp;<br>
she gave caution<br>
of danger to the rulers. At another time she wrote to Muwayiah: Fear God, He will protect you from men&nbsp;<br>
and when you will fear men, they will not be able to do you benefit in presence of God. Salam to you.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
So every adviser should advice according to the necessity of a particular man.<br>
<br>
There are foods and medicines in theological learnings food for all people and medicine for patients&nbsp;<br>
only. An illustration is given below. A man said to Abu Sayeed Khodri: Give me advice. He said: Fear&nbsp;<br>
God as it is the root of all good. Take recourse to Jihad, as there is no monkery in Islam. Take td the&nbsp;<br>
Quran, as it is the light for you among the inhabitants of the world and as it is a reminder to the&nbsp;<br>
inhabitants of heaven. Take to silence as you will drive away the devil therewith.<br>
<br>
Once a man said to Hasan Basari: Give me advice. He said: Honour the commandments of God, God will&nbsp;<br>
honour you. The wise Loqman advised his son: 0 my darling, attach your lance with the learned, but&nbsp;<br>
dispute not with them, lest they may cherish harted for you. Take from the world what is absolutely&nbsp;<br>
necessary for you and spend for your next world your excess wealth. Don't put your own burden to the&nbsp;<br>
shoulder of others by giving up completely this world. Keep fast in such a way as can destroy your&nbsp;<br>
greed and fast not in such a way as may spoil your prayer as prayer is better than fasting. Don't mix&nbsp;<br>
with the fools and hypocrites. He said to his son another time: 0 my darling, don't do any work with&nbsp;<br>
displeasure. Don's go out on a journey without necessity. Don't ask a thing which will not be&nbsp;<br>
beneficial to you. Don't squander your wealth and don't consider the wealth of others as good. What you&nbsp;<br>
send in advance is your wealth and what you leave behind is the wealth of others. 0 my darling, he who&nbsp;<br>
is kind gets kindness. He who keeps silent remains secure. He who speaks good gets benefit and he who&nbsp;<br>
speaks evil, commits sin. He who does not control his tongue becomes repentant. A man asked Hazrat Abu&nbsp;<br>
Hazem: Give me advice. He said: Do what will benefit you at the time of death and give up what will go&nbsp;<br>
against you at the time of death.<br>
<br>
Hazrat Moses said to Khizr: Give me advice. He said: walk with a smiling face and don't walk with an&nbsp;<br>
angry face. Be benefactor and not an injurious man. Give up disputation and walk not without necessity,&nbsp;<br>
don't laugh out without being<br>
56<br>
TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	57<br>
satisfies and don't accuse the sinners without sharing in their sins. 0 son of Imran, weep for your&nbsp;<br>
faults.<br>
A man said to Mohammad bin Keran: Give me advice. He said: Make efforts to please your Creator as you&nbsp;<br>
make efforts to satisfy yourself. A man asked Hamid Lefafa: Give me advice. He said: See that disasters&nbsp;<br>
and dangers may not destroy your religion. Prepare for it a cover like that of the Quran. He asked:&nbsp;<br>
What is the cover of religion? He said: To give up search of this world except for things absolutely&nbsp;<br>
necessary, not to talk except what is absolutely necessary and to give up the company of men except for&nbsp;<br>
dire necessity.<br>
I-Ia2fat Hasan Basari wrote to Caliph Abdul Aziz: After praise o C,od and blessings on the Prophet fear&nbsp;<br>
what God said of be feared. Be careful of what God said to be careful. Take for your fortune from what&nbsp;<br>
is in your possession. Sure news will come to you at the time of your death. Salam to you.<br>
Caliph Omar-b-Abdul Aziz wrote to Hazrat Hasan Basari: Write to me a letter advising me. He wrote in&nbsp;<br>
reply: After praise of God and blessing on His Prophet, cares and disasters lie before you. Either you&nbsp;<br>
must meet with salvation or with destruction. Know that one who takes account of himself gets benefit&nbsp;<br>
and he who is unmindful is a loser. He who sees the ultimate end gets salvation. He who conducts&nbsp;<br>
himself with greed is misguided. He who keeps patience rises above wants. He who fears God is secure.&nbsp;<br>
He who is secure accepts advice. He who accepts advice is blessed with deep insight. He who is blessed&nbsp;<br>
with deep insight gets understanding and wisdom. He who slips returns. He who repents uproots evils.&nbsp;<br>
Ask when you know not and restrain anger.<br>
The saint Matruf wrote to Caliph Omar-b-Abdul Aziz: After praise of'God and blessings on His Prophet: 0&nbsp;<br>
commander of the faithful, this world is an abode of punishment. He who has got not wisdom hoards&nbsp;<br>
wealth for it. He who has got no wisdom is deceived thereby. Live in this world as one who treats his&nbsp;<br>
wound and keeps patience at the bitterness of medicines fearing the result of disease. Caliph&nbsp;<br>
Omar-b-Abdul Aziz wrote to Adi-b- Artata: After Hamd and Salat, this world is an enemy of God's friends&nbsp;<br>
and a friend of the foes of God. It is an object of reception for the foes of God.<br>
He wrote to one of his governors: After praise of God and blessings on His Prophet, your power has been&nbsp;<br>
usurped from the oppression of the people. When you intend to do oppression on any one, remember God's&nbsp;<br>
power on you. Know that what reaches from you to the people will pass away but it will remain with you.&nbsp;<br>
Know that God will obtain for the oppressed people the rewards of the oppressors. Salam to you.<br>
<br>
Such are the forms of admonition and advice to the people. Such sort of advice is like food from which&nbsp;<br>
every one gets benefit. Such advisers are rare as the doors of advice have been closed and sin and&nbsp;<br>
disturbance gained ground. This is the first mode of treatment and the first root.<br>
<br>
SECOND ROOT IS PATIENCE: The basic medicine of repeated sins is patience. Why is patience necessary?&nbsp;<br>
One reason is that the sinner is careless about the injurious effect of good. Another reason is that&nbsp;<br>
his greed becomes strong. We have described the medicine for carelessness. Now we shall narrate the&nbsp;<br>
medicine of greed. The gist of it is that when a patient's injuries increase, his mode of treatment is&nbsp;<br>
that first of all he must have knowledge of the injury and then remove it so that it may not come to&nbsp;<br>
him again. In every circumstance, the bitterness of patience shall have to be adopted. There should be&nbsp;<br>
similar, treatment of sexual passion. He should first know the injurious effect of sin and think of the&nbsp;<br>
verses of the Quran and Hadis about it. When fear increases, he shall have to remove the cause which in&nbsp;<br>
crease the sexual passion. It grows out of outward things. To flee away from those things and to adopt&nbsp;<br>
loneliness are the medicines. The medince of the greed of delicious foods is to remain hungry and to&nbsp;<br>
fast consequitive days. Without patience these two modes cannot be adopted. Without knowledge fear does&nbsp;<br>
not grow. Knowledge also cannot arise without insight, thoughts and strong blind faith. The first thing&nbsp;<br>
is to be present in the assembly off. Zikr and sermons and then to hear religious sermons after giving&nbsp;<br>
up all thoughts of the world. God makes the path of one easy who has been given the strength of good&nbsp;<br>
attention, who fears God after knowing the objects of fear, who hopes for rewards and knows good words&nbsp;<br>
as true; and He makes the path of one difficult who straightens his hands, thinks himself above wants&nbsp;<br>
and knows the true things as false.<br>
58	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
CAUSES OF COMMISSION OF SINS<br>
1. First cause. The punishment of sin is not presently seen and lies in the womb of future.<br>
2. Second cause: It is the.present taste of the greed which leads to the sinful act. His habit assumes&nbsp;<br>
strong form owing to love for sin. Habit is the fifth nature. The present taste over nature&nbsp;<br>
predominates over the future tastes. For this reason God says, Never rather you love the present and&nbsp;<br>
discards the future. God says: Rather you love the pleasure of the world's life. The gravity of this&nbsp;<br>
affair is rendered clear from this word of the Prophet: Paradise is surrounded by unpleasant things and&nbsp;<br>
Hell by greed. The Prophet said: God said to Gabriel after creation of Hell: God and look at Hell. He&nbsp;<br>
saw it and said: By Thy glory, nobody will enter it if he hears of it. Then God surrounded it with&nbsp;<br>
things of greed and said to him: Go and look at it. Gabriel saw it and said: By Thy glory, I fear that&nbsp;<br>
there will be nobody who will not enter it. He created Paradise and said to Gabriel: Go and look at it.&nbsp;<br>
Gabriel saw it and said: By Thy glory, he who hears of it will want to enter it. Then he surrounded it&nbsp;<br>
with unpleasant things and said: Go now and see it. He saw it and said: By Thy glory. I fear that&nbsp;<br>
nobody will enter it. Greed is connected with the present and punishment with the future. There are two&nbsp;<br>
reasons for the commission of a sin though the basic faith remains alright. He who becomes impatient of&nbsp;<br>
thirst and drinks icy water during illness does not deny the basic science of medicine and also does&nbsp;<br>
not deny that it is injurious to his health, but the greed of his thirst becomes then strong and he&nbsp;<br>
becomes unable to face the difficulty of patience.<br>
3. Third cause There is no such a sinner who does not wish to expiate his sins by repentance and good&nbsp;<br>
works, but he makes delay to make repentance and expiation owing to the prevalence of long hope in him.<br>
4. Fourth cause There is no such believer who does not cherish hope for forgiveness of his sins. He&nbsp;<br>
awaits for pardon relying on the mercy of God after committing sins. For these four causes a believer&nbsp;<br>
is engaged in committing sins over and again even though his basic faithremains alright. It is true&nbsp;<br>
that for the fifth reason, defect enters into his basic faith.<br>
5. Fifth cause To entertain doubt about the Prophet-hood of Mohammed (P. H). This is infidelity.&nbsp;<br>
Medicines for these five<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	59<br>
reasons shall have to be looked into. Such a man is like the patient whom the physician prohibits to&nbsp;<br>
eat injurious foods. If the patient entertains doubt about the expert physician, he does not pay&nbsp;<br>
attention to his advice. This is disbelief or infidelity.<br>
Question: What are the medicines for those five causes?<br>
Answer: (1) The medicine for the first cause is to think of the delay of punishment in this way. What&nbsp;<br>
will occur in future must happen. The future is near the thoughtful men, but death is nearer to a man&nbsp;<br>
than the lace of his shoes. What will inform him that the Hour is near? Then the affairs of the future&nbsp;<br>
happiness will become the matters of the present. Great efforts are und_-rtaken to ward off future&nbsp;<br>
dangers in the world. For earning profits in business, merchants embarks on deep seas and oceans and&nbsp;<br>
bear all sorts of hardship in journey. If one falls ill and if a physician informs him that if he&nbsp;<br>
drinks cold water, it will injure him and may lead him to death, he shall give it up at once for fear&nbsp;<br>
of death, even though cold water is agreeable to him and even. though the pangs of death is short&nbsp;<br>
lived. He does not fear however what will occur after death. He shall have to leave the world and there&nbsp;<br>
is no escape from it. This world's life is temporary, not everlasting. Now it is an object of thought&nbsp;<br>
that he gives up an agreeable thing of this world relaying on the word of a Christian physician, while&nbsp;<br>
he cannot give up the temporary pleasure of the world in expectation of future happiness relying on the&nbsp;<br>
words of the Prophet supported by miracles. The punishment of Hell is very much greater than that of&nbsp;<br>
disease.<br>
(2) The medicine for the second cause is that he shall give up the taste which is strong with efforts&nbsp;<br>
and say: If I cannot give up this temporary happiness of this world's life, how can I get the&nbsp;<br>
everlasting happiness of the next world? When I can't bear the pangs of patience, how shall I bear the&nbsp;<br>
punishment of fire in Hell?<br>
(3) Disease of delay in repentance may be removed in this way. Most of the immates of Hell will shriek&nbsp;<br>
for long sufferings in Hell. He who makes delay in repentances, wishes to live long while he may die&nbsp;<br>
soon. If he lives long, he may not give up sin in future as he cannot give it up at present. It is not&nbsp;<br>
known how he will give up greed in future when he cannot give it up at present. Rather it may increase&nbsp;<br>
manifold owing to habits. The greed which man makes firm as a result of habits is not like that greed<br>
60	TAUBA	Vol-IV<br>
which has not become firmly rooted. For this reason, those who make. delay in repentance are destroyed.&nbsp;<br>
They don't know that the more time passes, the more it becomes difficult to be eradicated. The man of&nbsp;<br>
procrastination is like a man who seeing a firmly rooted tree, leaves it to be uprooted in future. But&nbsp;<br>
he knows that it will be more firmly rooted in future. The more you grow old, the more you will become&nbsp;<br>
weak and there will be less chance of your uprooting the tree.<br>
(4) Medicine of waiting for God's forgiveness. He is like a person who spends all his wealth and makes&nbsp;<br>
himself and his family members poor in expectation of His mercy. He hopes that God will bring out a&nbsp;<br>
hidden treasure for him out of uncultivated land. His waiting for seeking God's forgiveness for his&nbsp;<br>
sins is likewise.<br>
(5) Medicine for the fifth cause. To doubt the prophethood of the Prophet in infidelit. Its medicine is&nbsp;<br>
the proofs of his being a true Prophet. He must' be said: Is the affair in the next world impossible as&nbsp;<br>
the staying of a man in two different places at the same time is impossible? If he says: I have doubt&nbsp;<br>
in the next worldly affairs, he must be told: Eat the food which you have just left and into which some&nbsp;<br>
one has thrown poison. He shall not eat it believing a stranger's words. If he is a liar, you will&nbsp;<br>
still not eat the food, saying: I shall not eat it as it is better for me to remain on the good side&nbsp;<br>
and to have patience. But if he is true, I shall meet with death if I eat it. So to have patience is&nbsp;<br>
better than the pangs of death. Hazrat Ali said to a man who had no faith in the next world: If what&nbsp;<br>
you say is true, we will get salvation. If it does not come out true, we shall get salvation but you&nbsp;<br>
will perish. In other words, the wise man adopts always the path of safety. Such a disbeliever should&nbsp;<br>
be told: You give up food believing a stranger. How can you neglect the sayings of the prophets, saints&nbsp;<br>
and wise men backed by miracles? There is no good in arguing with the illiterate. If there is&nbsp;<br>
difference of opinion among the wise regarding the next world, the deniers will suffer endless&nbsp;<br>
sufferings if it is true. If it is false, then only your temporary pleasures will suffer for some&nbsp;<br>
time'. If anybody is wise, he must not doubt in this argument as there can be no comparison of these&nbsp;<br>
few days in this world with the everlasting nature of the next world. How can a wise man be able to&nbsp;<br>
earn everlasting happiness of the next world as he is engaged in the pleasures of the world?<br>

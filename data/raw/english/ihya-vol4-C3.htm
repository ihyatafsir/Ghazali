CHAPTER III<br>
FEAR AND HOPE<br>
Fear and hope are like two wings by which the friends of God can fly to every praised place and can&nbsp;<br>
cross the ways of the next world and reach the Almighty.<br>
What is Hope? Hope isa station out of the stations of religion and a condition of those who search.&nbsp;<br>
This hope is perfected by state knowledge and action. Knowledge is cause and state is its fruit. State&nbsp;<br>
again leads to action. Out of these three, state is called hope. Take an example. When you meet a&nbsp;<br>
hateable thing, you meet with three states what is at present what was before and what is hoped to&nbsp;<br>
remain in future. It is only a thing that is hoped for. If the future hoped for object is disliking, it&nbsp;<br>
produces pain in your heart which is called fear. To wait for a dear thing is called hope.<br>
This world is a seed ground for the next world. Mind is like earth and faith is like seed and divine&nbsp;<br>
service is like cultivation of the earth of mind. To purify mind is like canaldigging and the water&nbsp;<br>
flows towards the canal. The mind that is addicted to the world is like hard soil in which no seed can&nbsp;<br>
grow. The Resurrection Day is the day of reaping crops. He who sows seeds now can expect to reap fruits&nbsp;<br>
in the hereafter. If anybody sows seeds in a barren uncultivated land and does not water it, he&nbsp;<br>
entertains unnatural hope to get crops. So to wait for a dear thing is called hope. So whoever sows the&nbsp;<br>
seeds of faith in his heart waters it with the water of divine service, purifies the region of heart&nbsp;<br>
from the thorns of bad conduct and awaits the mercy of God to establish it upto his death, his waiting&nbsp;<br>
is called hope. That is good and real hope. The Prophet said: He who leads his life according to his&nbsp;<br>
low desires and yet hopes for paradise is a fool. God says: After them, such a nation became their&nbsp;<br>
successors who destroyed the prayer and followed their low desires. Soon they will will meet&nbsp;<br>
misguidance. God says: Those who have got faith those who migrated and fought in the way of God can&nbsp;<br>
hope for God's mercy-1:218 Q. In other words they are fit persons to hope for God's mercy. This means&nbsp;<br>
that those who act to the contrary can not expect to have God's mercy as they do not walk in the ways&nbsp;<br>
of God. Ihay-b-Ma'az said: To me that person is more a fool who hopes for forgiveness but remains&nbsp;<br>
engrossed in sins<br>
114	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>

without doing virtuoes acts, who hopes for the fruit of paradise after sowing the seeds of Hell, who&nbsp;<br>
hopes for the rank of the pious by doing sinful acts.<br>
<br>
Once a companion asked the Prophet: I ask you a question: what is the sign that God wants good of one&nbsp;<br>
man and does not want good of another man? He said: What is the condition of your mind when you get up&nbsp;<br>
from bed? He said: I get up from bed with love for the pious and good works. I soon do a good work at&nbsp;<br>
that time if I can and have firm faith that it will bring rewards. If I cannot do it, it pains me very&nbsp;<br>
rpuch and I hope for doing it. The Prophet said: This is the sign of one for whom God intends good. If&nbsp;<br>
He intends not to do good to you. He refrains you from that and He does not think into which well of&nbsp;<br>
Hell you fall and perish.<br>
<br>
MERITS OF HOPE: Love is made strong by hope. Take its instance from two kings. One king is feared for&nbsp;<br>
his punishment and another king is obeyed for getting rewards from him. For this reason hope is subject&nbsp;<br>
matter of good thought. God says: Don't be despaired of God's mercy -39:53 Q. So He made hopelessness&nbsp;<br>
unlawful. The story runs thus of Prophet Eakub that God revealed to him: Do you know why I made&nbsp;<br>
separation between you and Eusuf: The reason is that you uttered: I fear lest a tiger may eat him when&nbsp;<br>
you remain unmindful from him. Why did you entertain fear of tiger and not hoped in Me? Why did you&nbsp;<br>
look to the neglect of his brother and did not look to Me? The Prophet said: Let nobody die without&nbsp;<br>
having a good idea of God. He said: God says: I work according as My servant thinks of Me. Let him&nbsp;<br>
entertain any idea about Me. The Prophet once went to a man at the time of his death and asked him:&nbsp;<br>
What is your condition? He said: I fear for my sins and hope for my Lord's mercy. The Prophet said: God&nbsp;<br>
gives him mercy in whose mind fear and hope unite. Hazrat Ali saw a man very much despaired on account&nbsp;<br>
of his many sins. He said: 0 brother, your despair of God's mercy is a greater sin than your sins. The&nbsp;<br>
saint Sulaiman said: He who commits a sin and then feels that God has given him power over it and hopes&nbsp;<br>
for forgiveness. God forgives him. The reason is that God rebuked a people and said: This is because of&nbsp;<br>
your thought about your Lord which has destroyed you. God says: You entertained evil thoughts and for&nbsp;<br>
that you have met destruction. The Prophet said: God will say on the Resurrection Day to a servant: Why&nbsp;<br>
did you not prohibit when you saw an evil<br>
act being perpretated? He will say if he is taught the reply by God: 0 Lord, I hoped Thy mercy and&nbsp;<br>
feared men. God will say: I forgive you. There is in Hadis that a man lent loan to the people. He gave&nbsp;<br>
time to, the rich and rescued the distressed from the liabilities of debts. He did no other good works&nbsp;<br>
and met God who said to him: Who is more entitled to My forgiveness than him? He then forgive him as he&nbsp;<br>
had good idea about God and hoped for God's forgiveness inspite of having no merit of divine service.&nbsp;<br>
God says: Those who recite God's book, establish prayer and spend from what I give him of wealth openly&nbsp;<br>
and secretly hope for such a business which will never perish. The Prophet said: If you have known what&nbsp;<br>
I know, you would have surely laughed little and wept much and went out to wilderness and wept after&nbsp;<br>
clapping your breasts. Gabriel came down and said: Your Lord says to you. Why should He grow despair in&nbsp;<br>
our servants? Then he cam out and began to say words of hope and encouragement. There is in Hadis&nbsp;<br>
Qudsi-God sent revelation to David: If you love Me, love those who love Me and grow love in My&nbsp;<br>
servants. He said: 0 Lord, how can I grow love for Thee in Thy servants? He said: Remind them that&nbsp;<br>
every action of Mine is for their good and remind them of My mercy and kindness for them as they do not&nbsp;<br>
know from Me except good.<br>
The sage Ibn Abu Ayash used to give words of hope to the people. Someone dreamt after his death that he&nbsp;<br>
said: God took me to His presence and asked me: Why did you say words of hope to the people? He said: 0&nbsp;<br>
Lord, I hoped to enkindle love for Thee in the hearts of the people. God said: Then I have forgiven&nbsp;<br>
you.<br>
<br>
There is in another Hadis that a man of Banu Israil used to say words of despair to the people and mete&nbsp;<br>
out to them harsh treatment. God will say to him on the Resurrection Day: To-day I shall deprive you of&nbsp;<br>
My mercy as you deprived My servants of My mercy. The Prophet said: A certain man after living in Hell&nbsp;<br>
for one thousand years will cry aloud and say: 0 Merciful, God will then say to Gabriel: God and take&nbsp;<br>
My servant out of Hell. Then he will be taken out of Hell and will be asked to wait before his Lord.&nbsp;<br>
His Lord will ask him: How have you seen the place of Hell? He will reply: A very obnoxious place. God&nbsp;<br>
will say: Take him to his former place. Then he will walk and look behind. God will say: At what thing&nbsp;<br>
are you looking back? He will say: I hoped that after my deliverance from Hell. You will not take me&nbsp;<br>
back to Hell.<br>
6<br>
id says: Take him to Paradise. This shows that hope for God's !rcy will lead to his salvation.<br>
<br>
MEDICINE FOR DESPAIR AND MODE OF ACQUIRING )PE. Know, 0 dear readers that the medicine is required for&nbsp;<br>
two ;ses of patients. Despair is so strong on the first class patients that y give up divine service.&nbsp;<br>
Fear is so strong on the second class ients that they strive hard in divine service and thereby they&nbsp;<br>
troy themselves and their family members. These two classes of iple take a wrong path out of the middle&nbsp;<br>
path and go to the reme. so medicine is necessary for them in order that may walk he middle path. The&nbsp;<br>
who entertains false hope and commits sins ieving in the mercy of God and turns away from divine&nbsp;<br>
service, divine of hope for him is destruction like poison which is sweet dm like honey. He who has got&nbsp;<br>
cold and cough, honey is good for i but he who has got hot temper, honey is poison for him. The Idle&nbsp;<br>
path of everything is good. Hazrat Ali said: A learned man is mho does not prevent the people from the&nbsp;<br>
mercy of God and does give them guarantee from the wrath of God.<br>
<br>
TWO MODES OF INCREASING HOPE: The first mode is ing admonition and the second mode is the reading of&nbsp;<br>
the ran, Hadis and wisee sayings. Regarding admonition it is to nk of the gifts which we have described&nbsp;<br>
in the chapter of tefulness and to realise the gratefulness of God. He prescribed !rything what&nbsp;<br>
is.necessary for a man from the cradle to the ve. The second mode of increasing hope is to read the&nbsp;<br>
Quran I Hadis. The Quran says regarding hope: Tell those who pressed much on their soul: Don't be&nbsp;<br>
despaired of God's rcy. Surely God can forgive all sins. God is Forgiving , rciful-29:59 Q. God says:&nbsp;<br>
The angels glorify their Lord and k forgiveness for those who are in the earth-42:5Q. God says: it the&nbsp;<br>
fire of Hell which has been prepared for the infidles. God +s:. I warn you of the fire of Hell. Nobody&nbsp;<br>
except the fortunate enters therein -those who disbelieved and turned :k. God says: God is forgiving to&nbsp;<br>
the people inspite of their s. It is reported that the Holy Prophet used to pray constantly his people.&nbsp;<br>
He was even told: Are you not satisfied with the lowing verse: Your Lord is forgiving to the people&nbsp;<br>
inspits of !ir sins-13:6 Q. God says: Soon your Lord will give you such ng as will satisfy you-93: 5Q.&nbsp;<br>
In its Tafsir, it has been said that will not be satisfied even if a single man stays in Hell.<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	117<br>
Hadis:- The Prophet said: My people are the recipients of mercy. There is no punishment for them in the&nbsp;<br>
Hereafter. God sends down earth quakes and battles in the world as punishment. He said: Fever is a&nbsp;<br>
touch of Hell fire. It isa punishment from the fire of Hell for a believer. God says: God will not put&nbsp;<br>
the Prophet and his companions to shame on that day. In explaining this, it has been said that God&nbsp;<br>
revealed to His Prophet: I will entrust you to take account of your followers. He will say: 0 Lord, You&nbsp;<br>
are more kind to them than myself. God said: I will not put you to shame amongst them. Hazrat Anas&nbsp;<br>
reported that the Prophet prayed to God regarding the sins of his followers. He said: 0 Lord, entrust&nbsp;<br>
me with the judgement of my followers, so that their sins my not be expressed before others. Then God&nbsp;<br>
revealed to him: They are your peoples but My servants. I am more merciful to them than you. I will not&nbsp;<br>
entrust their account on others. You or any other man can not have proper look on them. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said: My life is good for you my death is also good for you. As long as I live, I will teach you the&nbsp;<br>
lessons of religion and establish for you laws and regulations. When I die your actions will be&nbsp;<br>
presented before me. I will thank God for the virtuous acts I will see and 1 will seek forgiveness to&nbsp;<br>
God for the sins I will see.<br>
The Prophet once heard a person praying: 0 God, I seek from Thee full perfect gift. He asked him: Do&nbsp;<br>
you know what is perfect gift? He replied: I don't know. The Prophet said: It is to enter paradise.&nbsp;<br>
There is in Hadis: When a servant commits a sin and seeks forgiveness to God, God says to His angels:&nbsp;<br>
Look to My servant. He has committed a sin and he knows that he has got his Lord who forgives all sins&nbsp;<br>
and gives punishment for sins. I testify to you that I have forgiven him. There is in another Hadis&nbsp;<br>
that if the sins of man reach so high as the clouds of the sky, I forgive him so long as he seeks My&nbsp;<br>
forgiveness and hopes for My forgiveness. There is in another Hadis: If My servant meets Me with&nbsp;<br>
earthful of sins, I meet him with earthful of forgiveness. There is in another Hadis: If a man commits&nbsp;<br>
a sin, the angel keeps his pen lifted up for six hours. If he repents and seeks forgiveness, he does&nbsp;<br>
not record it. If he does not do it, he records a sin. In another narration, when he commits a sin as&nbsp;<br>
well as a virtue, the right hand angel says to the left hand angel: Throw away this sin, rather I give&nbsp;<br>
up one tenth of this virtue for the sin and record nine-tenths of virtue. Then he throws away the sin.<br>
FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
118	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
The Prophet said: When a man commits a sin, it is recorded in his name. One desert Arab said: If he&nbsp;<br>
repents for that? The Prophet said: It is then wiped out from him. He again asked: If he commits sin&nbsp;<br>
again: The Prophet said: it is then recorded in his name. The desert Arab asked: If he repents? The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said: It is then wiped out from his record of deeds. He asked: How far is it done? The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said: So long he asks forgiveness and repents to God. God does not become tired of forgiveness till a&nbsp;<br>
man does not become tired of seeking forgiveness. When a man wishes to do a virtuous act, the right&nbsp;<br>
hand angel records a virtue in his name before he does a good work. If he translates his wish into&nbsp;<br>
action, he records ten merits for him. Then the Mereiful increases it up 700 merits. When he wishes to&nbsp;<br>
commit a sin, one sin is recorded for him and behind it God's for giveness is recorded for him.<br>
One day a man came to the Prophet and said to him: 0 Apostle of God, I fast during Ramzan, I will not&nbsp;<br>
keep fast beyond it. I pray five a times a day, I will not pray more. No Zakat is due on me. Pilgrimage&nbsp;<br>
is not compulsory on me. I will not do it even willingly. If I die in this state, where shall I remain?&nbsp;<br>
The Prophet smiled and said: Yes, if you can save your mind from treachery and hatred, control your&nbsp;<br>
tongue from back-biting and false speaking, protect your eye from seeing God's unlawful things and&nbsp;<br>
seeing with hatred any Muslim, you will be able to remain in paradise with me and I will place you upon&nbsp;<br>
my two palms.<br>
A desert Arab once came to the Prophet and asked him: 0 Prophet of God, who will judge among men on the&nbsp;<br>
Resurrection Day? He replied: The Almightly Merciful God. He asked: Will He judge himself? The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
replied: He will himself judge. At this, the desert Arab smiled. The Prophet asked him: 0 desert Arab,&nbsp;<br>
why have you smiled? He said: If an honorable man gets power, he pardons; and if he judges, he shows&nbsp;<br>
compassion. The Prophet said: This dessert Arab has spoken the truth. Beware, there is nobody more&nbsp;<br>
compassionate than God. He is the greatest of the compassionate. Then he said: This desert Arab is a&nbsp;<br>
wise man.<br>
There is in Hadis that God made the Ka'ba an object of veneration. If a man takes out a stone therefrom&nbsp;<br>
and destroys it and then burns it, he commits more sin than hating a friend of God. A desert Arab&nbsp;<br>
asked: Who is the friend of God? The Prophet<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	119<br>
said: All believers are the friends of God. Have you not heard the verse of God: God is the friend of&nbsp;<br>
those who believed. He takes them out from darkness into light-2:257 Q. There is in Hadis that a&nbsp;<br>
believer is better and more honorable than an angel, There is in another well known Hadis: God'recorded&nbsp;<br>
mercy on Himself before His creation. The Prophet said: He who recites 'There is no deity but God&quot; will&nbsp;<br>
enter Paradise. He who utters at the time of his death 'There is no deity but God'. Hell fire will not&nbsp;<br>
touch him. Hell has been made unlawful for one who meets with God without setting up partner with God.&nbsp;<br>
There is in Hadis: He in whose heart there is faith to the weight of a mustard seed will not enter&nbsp;<br>
Hell. The Prophet said: If a believer knows the extent of mercy of God, he would not have become&nbsp;<br>
despaired of Paradise.<br>
<br>
The Prophet read this verse of the Quran: The earthquake of the Hour will be most severe. He said: Do&nbsp;<br>
you know which is this day? On this day Adam will be asked: Rise up and send to Hell out of your&nbsp;<br>
progenitors. He will ask: How many? He will be told: 999 out of every thousand will go Hell and only&nbsp;<br>
one to Paradise. Every one present began to weep and refrained from works. The Prophet came to them and&nbsp;<br>
asked: What is the matter with you that you refrained from your works? They said: After hearing what&nbsp;<br>
you said, who will do works? He asked: Where is the explanation what will be you number out of so many&nbsp;<br>
peoples? Series, Mensaq, Eajuz and Meajuz are some peoples. Nobody knows their numbers except God. You&nbsp;<br>
are like white hairs on the back of a black ox in comparison with other peoples and like a different&nbsp;<br>
color in the foot of a quadruped animal.<br>
<br>
The People said: If you had not committed sin, I would have feared the worst sin from you. He was&nbsp;<br>
asked: What is it? He said: Self-praise. The Prophet said: By him in whose hand there is my life, God's&nbsp;<br>
mercy upon His servants is much more than the affection of a mother for her children. There is in&nbsp;<br>
another Hadis: God has got mercy of one hundred divisions. He has kept for himself 99 divisions of&nbsp;<br>
mercy and distributed one division only in the earth on account of which the created beings show&nbsp;<br>
kindness to one another, mothers show affection to their children and the lower animals to their young&nbsp;<br>
ones. On the Resurrection day. He will unite these one hundred divisions and show mercy<br>
on His creations.<br>
120	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	121<br>
The Prophet said: Act, give good news and know that only divine service of anybody will not give him&nbsp;<br>
salvation. The Prophet said: I have reserved intercession for those who commit great sins out of my&nbsp;<br>
followers. Do you hope that those who do divine service and who are God-fearing will get that? Rather&nbsp;<br>
my intercession will go for the sinners and the guilty.<br>
Wise sayings:- Hazrat Ali said: God is more honorable than exposing the sins in the next world which He&nbsp;<br>
kept secret in the world. God is more just on a servant who suffers for a sin in the world than&nbsp;<br>
inflicting on him another punishment. A certain sage said: When a believer commits a sin, God keeps it&nbsp;<br>
secret from the angels, so that they may not see it and bear witness therefor. Hazrat Hasan Basari&nbsp;<br>
said: If a believer did not commit any sin, he could fly in the sky but God humbled him on account of&nbsp;<br>
his sins.<br>
There is in Hadis that two men of Banu Israil made friendship for the sake of God. One of them&nbsp;<br>
oppressed much on his soul and another was religious. The latter advised his friend and warned him. His&nbsp;<br>
friend used to reply: Leave me to God. He has not appointed you as guard over me. One day the religious&nbsp;<br>
man saw his friend committing a great sin and being greatly dissatisfied said to him. God will not&nbsp;<br>
forgive you. He said: God will say to the sinner: Is there anybody to snatch My mercy on My servant?&nbsp;<br>
Go, I have forgiven him. He will say to the religious man: Hell is fixed for you. He will say: By One&nbsp;<br>
in whose hand, there is my life; you have uttered such a word by which you have destroyed your world&nbsp;<br>
and the next world.<br>
The sage Mosruq reported that a certain prophet fell in prostration when a sinner gave such a forceful&nbsp;<br>
strike on his neck by his foot that the stone on which he was prostrating shifted away. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
flew into rage and said: Go God will not forgive you. God then revealed to the Prophet: you have taken&nbsp;<br>
oath over Me regarding My servant. I have forgiven him. Once the Prophet grew into rage on the&nbsp;<br>
polytheists and cursed them. At once revelation came down: You have got no hand in the matter.&nbsp;<br>
Thereafter he gave up cursing.<br>
A certain sage said: Two religious men were equal in divine services and they entered paradise. One of&nbsp;<br>
them got much higher rank therein. Another man said: 0 Lord, this man did not do divine service more&nbsp;<br>
than myself, but you have raised him to the<br>
highest of paradise. God said: He has prayed to Me higher rank but you have prayed only salvation from&nbsp;<br>
Hell fire. So I rewarded him according to the prayer of each man. This shows that it is better to do&nbsp;<br>
divine service being hopeful of higher and higher rank, as he who loves with hope is better than one&nbsp;<br>
who loves with fear. For this reason, the Prophet said: Pray for high rank to God, as you pray to God,&nbsp;<br>
the Most Compassionate. The Prophet also said: When you pray to God, pray for Ferdous paradise with&nbsp;<br>
great hope, as there is nothing greater to the Almighty than it.<br>
It has been reported that one day a Magian guest came to the Prophet Ibrahim. He said to the guest: If&nbsp;<br>
you accept Islam, I will entertain you, At this that Magian went away. At once revelation came to&nbsp;<br>
Abraham: 0 Abraham, you have not given food to the Magian as he has not changed his religion. I am&nbsp;<br>
giving him provision for the last 70 years inspite of his infidelity. There was no harm if you had&nbsp;<br>
entertained the Magian for a night. Then the Prophet searched for the Magian, took him to his house and&nbsp;<br>
entertained him. Thereafter he accepted Islam.<br>
The sage Ibrahim Atrash said: We sat one day with the great saint Ma'ruf Karkhi on the bank of the&nbsp;<br>
Tigris. At that time some young men were drinking wine and beating drums and sporting He said to Ma'ruf&nbsp;<br>
Karkhi: Are you not seeing the youths committing sins openly? Shower curse on them. At once he raised&nbsp;<br>
up his two hands and prayed; 0 Lord, as you have given them enjoyment in the world. So give them such&nbsp;<br>
enjoyment in the thereafter. The Prophet said: We have asked you to shower curse on them. He said: When&nbsp;<br>
He will give them enjoyment in the next world. He will give them the grace of Tauba or repentance in&nbsp;<br>
this world.<br>
WHAT IS FEAR?<br>
Know, 0 dear readers, that fear is a painful state of mind like burning fire in fear of a future&nbsp;<br>
calamity. He who has cemented love with God and whose heart is strong with truth and illumined with the&nbsp;<br>
brightness of truth has got no fear or hope and his condition as above fear or hope. In short when the&nbsp;<br>
mind of a lover is engrossed in the sight of the beloved, fear of separation and hope of sight are&nbsp;<br>
injurious for him.<br>
THREE CAUSES OF FEARFUL STATE: The state of fear arises in mind for three causes knowledge, state and&nbsp;<br>
action. The<br>
I<br>
122	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	123<br>
cause of knowledge of fear arises in mind owing to an undesirable act. For instance, a man fears to be&nbsp;<br>
killed if he is arrested on account of a crime against the king or State. The more powerful is the&nbsp;<br>
thing the more is the fear. If a man falls under the clutches of a ferocious beast, he entertains a&nbsp;<br>
great fear. Similar is the fear of God, as it arises from a knowledge of the attributes of God. If He&nbsp;<br>
destroys the whole world, He does not care and nobody can prevent Him. Such fear sometimes arises owing&nbsp;<br>
to commission of sins. The more is the knowledge of God, the more is He feared, The Prophet said: I&nbsp;<br>
fear God greater than you all. God said: The learned among My servants fear Me most.<br>
<br>
THREE EXPRESSIONS OF FEAR:; (1) The signs of the burning of heart is expressed in bodily organs and&nbsp;<br>
nature. Slothness body being yellow, falling into swoon crying and weepingg are the signs of fear on&nbsp;<br>
body. Then he meets with bitterness and faces death which reduces intellect and despair and failure&nbsp;<br>
grow. If fear is expressed in bodily organs, the body can not move to commit sins as it remains&nbsp;<br>
confined to virtuous acts sand prepares for the future after repenting for the past misdeeds. For this&nbsp;<br>
reason, it has been said: He who weeps and wipes out tears is not a fearful man but the fearful man is&nbsp;<br>
he who gives up the objects of fears for fear of punishment. He who fears a thing, flees away from it.&nbsp;<br>
He who fears God flees to Him. The saint Jun-Num was asked: When does a servant fear?, He said: When he&nbsp;<br>
takes himself to the position of a patient -and saves himself for fear of continued disease. If fear is&nbsp;<br>
expressed in nature, he controls his passions, gives up pleasures and enjoyments and his dear actions&nbsp;<br>
become disliking to him just as honey is hated by one who comes to know that there is poison therein.&nbsp;<br>
His desires then are burnt and his limbs come under control. There come then in mind modesty and&nbsp;<br>
humility and there go away pride, conceit and hatred. He then engages himself in Morakaba (meditation),&nbsp;<br>
taking account of actions and making efforts for divine service. He then becomes like a person who&nbsp;<br>
falls in the clutches of a ferocious beast. Such is the condition of one in whose heart fear is strong.&nbsp;<br>
Such was the condition of the companions and their successors.<br>
<br>
STAGES OF FEAR: The lowest sign of fear that is expressed in action is to abstain from unlawful and&nbsp;<br>
prohibited things. The<br>
fear which keeps away from unlawful things is fear of sin. If the proportion of fear is excessive and&nbsp;<br>
it keeps one away from doubtful things, it is called Taqwa or self-abnegation. The meaning of Taqwa is&nbsp;<br>
to give up doubtful things and to act on things of sure faith. The fear which gives advice to give up&nbsp;<br>
everything in excess except what is absolutely necessary for a man is called Taqwa or God fear. If this&nbsp;<br>
Taqwa reaches to such a high pitch that it leads a man to erect no other house except one to reside,&nbsp;<br>
not to hoard anything which is eatable, not to look to the world with this knowledge that it shall have&nbsp;<br>
to be left behind and not to pass a minute without remembrance of God, it is called Sidq or&nbsp;<br>
truthfulness ad such a man in called Siddiq or a great truthful man. Taqwa is a higher stage of fear of&nbsp;<br>
unlawful things, because it keeps away not only from unlawful things but also from things of doubtful&nbsp;<br>
nature. Sidq is a higher stage than Taqwa. So a Siddiq possesses three qualities fear of unlawful&nbsp;<br>
things, fear of doubtful things fear of losing a moment without remembrance of God and possessing other&nbsp;<br>
qualities as mentioned above.<br>
CLASS OF FEAR. Fear is good, specially God-fear with which He guides His servants to knowledge and&nbsp;<br>
action, so that they may attain nearness of God. As a lower animal requires a stick, so also a boy. So&nbsp;<br>
fear has got increase, decrease and middle state and the middle state of fear is the best. The fear&nbsp;<br>
which is weak can be called modesty. Too much fear leads to despair and prevent actions. It grows&nbsp;<br>
disease, weakness, senselessness, loss of intellect and memory. The object of fear is to give&nbsp;<br>
encouragement to actions. The Prophet narrated the causes of hope, as excessive fear leads to despair.&nbsp;<br>
The benefits of fear is to take care, to give up unlawful things and doubtful things, to make efforts&nbsp;<br>
for divine service and to engage in Zikr, Fikr and such other things which take one near God.<br>
Fear generates avoidance of undesirable things which are of different classes. One kind of undesirable&nbsp;<br>
thing is naturally an object of dislike such as fire. Another kind of undesirable thing leads to&nbsp;<br>
dangers and sorrows. A patient does not like fruits as they may lead him to death.<br>
Of all the fears, the greatest is the fear of ultimate end as it is the greatest object of thought and&nbsp;<br>
above all fears. What is in fate is known only to God and it is the result of Taqdir. For instance a&nbsp;<br>
king has written an order. Nobody knows whether the order is<br>
124	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	125<br>
for killing him or for giving him rewards. So until he receives the order, he keeps himself busy with&nbsp;<br>
thought. The Prophet once stood on a pulpit and said after catching his right hand: This is God's book&nbsp;<br>
wherein all the names of the dewellers of paradise and the names of their fathers have been written.&nbsp;<br>
Then he caught his left hand and said: This is God's book. Therein the names of the dewellers of Hell&nbsp;<br>
and the names of their fathers have been written. The fortunate sometimes will do the works of the&nbsp;<br>
unfortunate till the people will say: They are included within the unfortunate people. Before their&nbsp;<br>
death, they will be rescued by God even though for a short while. The unfortunate will do the works of&nbsp;<br>
the fortunate till the people will say: They appertain to the fortunate ones but God will take them out&nbsp;<br>
of fortune even though for a short while. The fortunate are those whose names were recorded as&nbsp;<br>
fortunate in the original record of deeds and the unfortunate are those whose names were recorded as&nbsp;<br>
unfortunate in the original records deeds. Action will be judged by the condition of the ultimate end.<br>
<br>
There are differenccces between two men-one fearss sin and another fears God's glory and attributes.&nbsp;<br>
The first man may have got faulty ideas but the latter lives in security. He who recognises God and His&nbsp;<br>
attributes fears God without committing sin. He who is fortunate feels easy to tread the paths of&nbsp;<br>
virtue and he who is unfortunate feels difficulty to tread them. He who raised the Prophet to the&nbsp;<br>
highest paradise recorded him as such before he was born. He who was recorded as virtuous entertains a&nbsp;<br>
strong will to do virtuous acts and he who was recorded as a great sinner entertains a will to do evils&nbsp;<br>
and sinful acts. So everybody should fear what was recorded in his original fate.<br>
<br>
It is in Hadis that God revealed to the Prophet David: 0 David, fear Me as you fear a destructive&nbsp;<br>
ferocious beast. This will make you understand the original object of fear. This is not stayed for any&nbsp;<br>
cause of fear, as to know cause and to know the secret of Taqdir are the same. A ferocious beast is not&nbsp;<br>
feared for its fault, but for its ferocious nature, attack, strength, fearful look etc. and it does not&nbsp;<br>
hesitate to kill. It does not care whether you live or die. For God there is the highest example. The&nbsp;<br>
inner sight of one who has recognised Him is stronger than his sight of open eyes.<br>
MERITS OF FEAR<br>
Merits of fear are known in two ways - by guess and meditation and by the Quran and Hadis. The mode of&nbsp;<br>
guess and meditation is this that there is good of a thing in proportion to the good fortune of meeting&nbsp;<br>
with Lord in the next world as there is no good fortune without meeting and companionship with God.&nbsp;<br>
;There is good in that thing which helps towards that goal and that depends on proportion of the&nbsp;<br>
object. It appears from this that there is no alternative for meeting with Him in the next world&nbsp;<br>
without earning love for Him in this world. His love can not be attained without His knowledge and His&nbsp;<br>
knowledge is not possible without constant thought about Him and remembering Him. That is not possible&nbsp;<br>
without severance of relegious and attachment from the world. Attachment for this world is not again&nbsp;<br>
possible without giving up worldly comforts and passions and low desires. They are not possible if they&nbsp;<br>
are not kept under control and passions cannot be brought under control without fear. So the fire of&nbsp;<br>
fear burns the evil desires and passions. The more they are burnt, the more the merits of fear will be&nbsp;<br>
achieved. So there is difference of merits according to the difference and degree of fear.<br>
MODE OF THE QURAN AND HADIS: There are innumerable verses of the Quran and Hadis about the merits of&nbsp;<br>
fear. Fear has been united in four things for a God-fearing man-guidance, grace, knowledge and&nbsp;<br>
pleasure. These are the attributes of the dwellers of heaven and God grants them at the same time. Here&nbsp;<br>
are the verses. God says : For those who fear their Lord is guidance and favour-7 : 154Q, God says :&nbsp;<br>
The learned out of His servants fear God most-35 : 28Q. This is because of their knowledge. God says :&nbsp;<br>
God is pleased with them and they are also pleased with God - 98 : 8 Q. These speak of knowledge which&nbsp;<br>
leads to fear. Moses said : Those who fear God have got the Highest as their companion and they do not&nbsp;<br>
set up any partner with Him. This is because they are learned men who will get the rank of the&nbsp;<br>
companions of the Prophets, as they are their heirs.<br>
ROOT OF FEAR: The root of fear is knowledge and its fruit is fear of unlawful things and fear of&nbsp;<br>
doubtful things. God gave speciality to fear by keeping His relation with it. He says : God will not&nbsp;<br>
accept its flesh and blood, but He will accept from you<br>
126	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	127<br>
Taqwa or God-fear-37: 22 Q. Taqwa means to give up unlawful things owing to fear. For this reason, God&nbsp;<br>
says : The most honorable of you is one who is most God fearing-49 : 13. He therefore gave order to&nbsp;<br>
fear Him to the predecessors and successors. God says : I ordered those before you who were given the&nbsp;<br>
book and you to fear God. God says : Fear Me if you are believers. He made fear compulsory on the&nbsp;<br>
believers. For this reason, a believer is not free from fear. If he is weak in faith, his fear also&nbsp;<br>
becomes weak.<br>
<br>
The Prophet said with regard to God-fear : God said : 0 men. I gave you dynastic honour and you also&nbsp;<br>
gave superiority to dynastic honour. Now take your dynastic honour and establish Mine, I said : He who&nbsp;<br>
is most God fearing amongst you is the most honorable of you. You did not admit it, you gave&nbsp;<br>
superiority to one who is rich. He will then address the God fearing men: 0 God fearing men, where are&nbsp;<br>
you? A standard will be raised for this and they will follow it and reach their destination and enter&nbsp;<br>
paradise without account.<br>
<br>
The Prophet said: God fear in the root of all wisdom. The Prophet told Ibn Mas'ud : If you wish to meet&nbsp;<br>
me, fear God after my death. The saint Fazil said : He who fears God will be led to every good. The&nbsp;<br>
saint Shibli said : On the day I feared God, the door of my wisdom and admonition was opened in such a&nbsp;<br>
way which I did not see before. The sage Ihya-b-Ma'az said : Two virtues of a believer-fear of&nbsp;<br>
punishment and hope of forgiveness assume such state as that of a hare between two tigers. Moses said :&nbsp;<br>
God will say on the Resurrection Day : There is no such person whose account I will not take or into&nbsp;<br>
whose accounts I will not enquire. I will not however take the accounts of those who feared unlawful&nbsp;<br>
things as I shall feel ashamed to take their accounts. They are more honorable than two await them for&nbsp;<br>
accounts. God says : For him who fears the Glory of his Lord, there are two gardens-54 : 45Q. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said : God says : By my honour, I will not place two fears and to securities upon My servants.&nbsp;<br>
If he lives without fearing Me in the world, I will throw him in fear in the next world. If he fears Me&nbsp;<br>
in the world. I will make him free from fear in the next world. The Prophet said : Everything fears one&nbsp;<br>
who fears God and God shows fear from everything to one who fears other than God.<br>
The Prophet said: He who fears God most amongst you and daily observes most the injunctions and&nbsp;<br>
prohibitions of God is an experienced wise man. The saint Ihya-b-Ma'az said : The son of Adam is&nbsp;<br>
unfortunate. If he feared Hell as he fears poverty, he would have entered Paradise. The saint Jun-Nun&nbsp;<br>
said : Whose fears God much, his love for God deepens and his wisdom is purified. He also said that&nbsp;<br>
fear should be much more than hope. If fear is strong, mind becomes disturbed. The sage Abul Hussain&nbsp;<br>
Jarir used to say : Fear of misfortune is the sign of fortune, as fear is like a string between God and&nbsp;<br>
His servants. When it is severed, he is destroyed with the destroyed thing. The saint Sahal Tastari&nbsp;<br>
said : God fear will not come in you till you do not eat lawful things. The saint Abu Solaiman Darani&nbsp;<br>
said : If mind is ruined, fear goes away. Hazrat Ayesha asked : 0 Prophet of God, &quot;God says : Those who&nbsp;<br>
have been given wealth, spend and their hearts are fearful.&quot; Can such men commit theft and fornication&nbsp;<br>
? The Prophet said : They can not commit theft and fornication, rather they fast, pray, pay zakat, but&nbsp;<br>
they fear whether those will be accepted or not. So there are innumerable saying about the merits of&nbsp;<br>
fear.<br>
<br>
Hope and fear are mixed up together. He who hopes to get his desired thing fears for its loss. For this&nbsp;<br>
reason God says : They pray to Me out of hope and fear. He says : They call their Lord out of fear and&nbsp;<br>
hope. God says : What is the matter with you that you do not hope for the sake of God? It means : Why&nbsp;<br>
don't you fear Him. God says : Laugh little and weep much. God says: They weep and their fear&nbsp;<br>
increases. the Prophet said : If the two eyes of a believer shed tears so small as the head of a bee&nbsp;<br>
and it flows down his cheek, God will make that place unlawful for the fire of Hell. He also said : If&nbsp;<br>
the mind of believer trembles owing to fear of God, his sins fall down like the falling down of the&nbsp;<br>
leaves of a tree.<br>
<br>
The Prophet said: 0 God, give me provision of two eyes shedding profuse tears. The Prophet said : On&nbsp;<br>
the day on which there will be no shade except the shade of God, God will give shade to seven persons.&nbsp;<br>
He mentioned about that person also who shed tears through his two eyes remembering God in loneliness.&nbsp;<br>
Hazrat Abu Bakr Siddiq said : Let him weep who can weep and let him assume weeping who can not weep.&nbsp;<br>
The saint Abu Solaiman Darani said : The face of one whose eyes shed tears<br>
128	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
will have no uncleanliness on the Resurrection Day. If his eyes shed tears, the first drop of tears&nbsp;<br>
will extinguish fire like ocean. If any man shed tears among a party of men, God will not punish that&nbsp;<br>
party of men. The saint Sulaiman said: Weeping comes from fear, and hope and pleasure come from love&nbsp;<br>
and attachment. Hazrat Abdullh-b-Amer said : One drop of tears is dearer to me than the charity of one&nbsp;<br>
thousand gold coins.<br>
Hazrat Hanzalah reported: We were once near the Prophet who was giving us sermon. Our minds became soft&nbsp;<br>
for that and our eyes shed tears. Thereafter we returned to our houses and began to talk worldly&nbsp;<br>
matters with our wives. We forgot the state in which we were near the Prophet. We thought that we have&nbsp;<br>
turned hypocrites. I said: 0 Prophet of God our mind became soft when we were near you and our eyes&nbsp;<br>
shed tears. When we returned to our houses and mixed with our wives that state of mind went away. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet said: 0 Hanzalah, had you been in that state of mind all along, the angels would have&nbsp;<br>
handshaked with you in your paths and beds. 0 Hanzalah, mind changes every moment.<br>
Hazrat Ali said to one of his sons: 0 darling fear God in such a way that if earth-load of virtues is&nbsp;<br>
given to Him. He will, not consider it as fit to be accepted from you and hope for mercy of God in such&nbsp;<br>
a way that if earth-load of sins is given to Him. He will forgive you. For this reason Hazrat Omar&nbsp;<br>
said: If all men are called for entering Hell except one men. I hope that he shall be myself. If all&nbsp;<br>
men are called to enter Paradise except one man, I fear I may be that man. This is the end of hope and&nbsp;<br>
fear.<br>
The Prophet said: Some one will do the deeds of a dweller of Paradise for fifty years, even there will&nbsp;<br>
remain only half a cubit distance between him and Paradise. Then suddenly his fate comes and his death&nbsp;<br>
ends with the deeds of a deweller of Hell. So everybody should be fearful of his ultimate end. Hazrat&nbsp;<br>
Ihya-bMaaz said: He who worships God only for fear of God, is immerged in the sea of thoughts. He who&nbsp;<br>
worships God hoping only His mercy, wanders in the field of mistake. He who worships God out of fear&nbsp;<br>
and hope, is established on the high way of remembrance of God.<br>
It is better that there should be increase of fear before death. When death becomes near, hope and good&nbsp;<br>
idea are better. Whose<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	129<br>
desires to meet with God, God also likes to meet with him. When there remains no object of love except&nbsp;<br>
remembrance of God and thoughts about Him and His creations then the world becomes prison to him, as&nbsp;<br>
prison means such a place where one can not meet his beloved things Death releases him from that prison&nbsp;<br>
and he is awarded such thing as &quot;no eye hath seen, no ear hath heard and no heart hath conceived&quot;. So&nbsp;<br>
it is better to accept the advice of the Prophet who said: '0 God, give me the provision of Thy love&nbsp;<br>
and the love of those who love Thee and the love of those who lead towards Thy love. Make Thy love to&nbsp;<br>
me dearer than cold drink'. So at the time of death, hope should be strong as it leads to love. Before&nbsp;<br>
death, fear should be strong as it burns passions and roots, out from mind the love for this world. For&nbsp;<br>
this reason, the Prophet said: Let nobody die among you without having a good idea about his Lord. God&nbsp;<br>
says: I act according as My servant entertains idea about Me. So let him entertain any idea bout Me&nbsp;<br>
what he likes.<br>
p<br>
MEDICINE FOR ACQUIRING FEAR OF GOD: There are v.o modes of generating fear. This is explained by an&nbsp;<br>
illustration. When a child remains in a room, he does not fear when a ferocious beast or a snake comes&nbsp;<br>
to him. Even he extends ' his .hand to catch them. If his father comes there, he fears them and flees&nbsp;<br>
away. When the child sees his father doing so, he also flees away out of fear. The second mode is that&nbsp;<br>
his father fears as he knows the destructive poison of the snake and ferocious attack of the beast. The&nbsp;<br>
child has got fear only from hearing from his father about their nature as he has full faith in his&nbsp;<br>
father. Similarly there are two modes for fear of God. The first mode is the fear of His punishment and&nbsp;<br>
the second mode is to fear Him.<br>
When death came to Solaiman Taimi, he said to his sons: Read out to me the Hadis which contains words&nbsp;<br>
of ultimate end and remind me of the words of hope till I can meet Him with good idea. At the time of&nbsp;<br>
the death of Sufian Saori, he called the,. learned men who sat round him and made him hear words of&nbsp;<br>
hope. At the time of the death of Imam Ahmad-b-Hanbal, he said to his son: Let me hear those traditions&nbsp;<br>
which contain words of hope and good idea. God revealed to Prophet David: Make Me dear to My servants.&nbsp;<br>
He asked God: By what means? God said: Remind them of My mercy and gifts. So fortune means to court&nbsp;<br>
death with love of God.<br>
130	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
The learned and the pious men fear those verses of God which excite fear. God says: 'Fear God as is due&nbsp;<br>
to Him'-3: 102. Most of the people fear punishment. The second kind of fear is high and that is to fear&nbsp;<br>
God, to fear to remain distant from Him, to fear falling of screen between Him and His servant. The&nbsp;<br>
saint Jun-Nun said: The fear of Hell is like a drop of water when compared with the fear of separation&nbsp;<br>
from God. The general believers fear like the fear of a child of a snake. That is on account of blind&nbsp;<br>
faith. This fear is weak and it goes away on the first onslaught.<br>
<br>
God said after creation: -'These are the dwellers of Paradise and I don't care. These are the dwellers&nbsp;<br>
of Hell and I don't care'. If it occurs in your mind that He will not punish without sin and will not&nbsp;<br>
give rewards without divine service, then think over the matter that He helps the worshipers in such a&nbsp;<br>
way that they are compelled to worship whether they wish or not and He helps the sinners with sins in&nbsp;<br>
such a way that they are compelled to commit sins whether they wish or not. Is it for their past sins?&nbsp;<br>
Has the past any limit? Is it for his first sin which was recorded in his book of deeds? The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
said to this effect that there was altercation between Adam and Moses before their Lord. Moses said to&nbsp;<br>
Adam that for his fault. God sent down his descendants from heaven to the earth. Adam said: How many&nbsp;<br>
years before my creation, did you come to know that He had written the Torah? Moses said: 40 years&nbsp;<br>
before. Adam said: Did you not see therein that Adam was misguided being disobedient to his Lord? Moses&nbsp;<br>
said: I saw it. Adam then said to Moses: You now impute fault to me for such an action which God&nbsp;<br>
recorded 40 years before it was done by me, or before my creation. Thus Moses quarrelled with Adam.<br>
<br>
So those who come to know the original cause which arises from the light of guidance enquire about the&nbsp;<br>
secret causes of Taqdir. Those who believe it only by hearing are included within the general&nbsp;<br>
believers. These two classes acquire the quality of fear as every person falls within the clutches of a&nbsp;<br>
mighty power just as a boy falls within the clutches of a ferocious beast. God created the ferocious&nbsp;<br>
beasts of this world as well as of the next and instruments of punishments. According to the dictates&nbsp;<br>
of the orignal fate one is guided towards that for which he was created. He created paradise and its&nbsp;<br>
dwellers and made subservient to<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	131<br>
them some instruments or causes inspite of their willingness or unwillingness. He created Hell and its&nbsp;<br>
dwellers and their punishments or causes inspite of their willingness or unwillingness. So whoever sees&nbsp;<br>
himself immerged in the current of Taqdir, it is inevitable that he should fear. This is the fear of&nbsp;<br>
those who recognise God. He who has not been raised to the stage of deep insight has got the only means&nbsp;<br>
of hearing the Quran and Hadis and reading the actions and behaviours of the God-fearing. Those who are&nbsp;<br>
free from this fear belong to the party of Pharaoh and the fools. Our Prophet is the leader of men&nbsp;<br>
past, present and future, yet he was the most God fearing man.<br>
<br>
It is reported that he led funeral prayer of a boy and said: 0 God, save him from the punishment of the&nbsp;<br>
grave and Hell. In another narration, he heard a person say: What a joy for you, a sparrow out of the&nbsp;<br>
sparrows of Paradise. He was dissatisfied with that and said: Who will inform you that it may be&nbsp;<br>
otherwise. By God, I am the Apostle of God, I don't know what will be my case. God created Paradise and&nbsp;<br>
its dwellers. They will not increase or decrease. When one of the dwellers of Ahle-Suffa died, his&nbsp;<br>
mother cried: Happy are you, you are a bird of Paradise. You have migrated to the Prophet and is a&nbsp;<br>
martyr in the way of God. The Prophet said: Who will inform you that perhaps he uttered such a word&nbsp;<br>
which did not do any benefit, to him and perhaps he was miser in such a work which did not do him any&nbsp;<br>
injury. The Prophet said: The chapters Hud and such like chapters, chapter Waqeah (56Q). chapter&nbsp;<br>
Eja-Shamsu Kobberat (81 Q), chapter Naba (78) made my hairs grey. There are verses of fear in the Quran&nbsp;<br>
from the beginning to the end for those who read it with care and meditation. The Prophets remained in&nbsp;<br>
fear inspite of the shower of mercy on them as they were not safe from the contrivance of God. When the&nbsp;<br>
Prophet Abraham was thrown into fire, he said: God is sufficient for me. This was his greatest&nbsp;<br>
invocation in his great trail. Gabriel met him in the fire and asked him: Have you got any necessity.&nbsp;<br>
Abraham said: I have got no necessity from you. God is sufficient for me. He fulfilled his word for&nbsp;<br>
which God gave him this news: And` Abraham is he who fulfilled-53:37.<br>
<br>
In the battle of Badr when the strenght of the Muslims was weak, Prophet prayed : 0 God, if You destroy&nbsp;<br>
this small party, there will remain in the world not a single man to worship Thee.<br>
<br>
132	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
Hazrat Abu Bakr then said : What your Lord has promised with yoiu will certainly come true.<br>
The Prophet Jesus will be asked on the Resurrection Day Did you say to the people : take myself and my&nbsp;<br>
mother as Lords besides God? He will reply : You are pure, what right have I got that I will tell them&nbsp;<br>
over which I have got no control. If I had said that, you know it best. You know what is in my mind,&nbsp;<br>
but I do not know what is in your mind. If you punish them, they are your mere servants and if you&nbsp;<br>
forgive them, you are and Almighty, Most Wise-15:116.<br>
Nobody can be safe about his condition as the heart of a believer is confined within two fingers of the&nbsp;<br>
Merciful and human mind changes more than the bubbles of hot water. He who remains safe from the&nbsp;<br>
contrivance of Lord is ignorant. A sage Bald : If anybody gets llalyldllll ll on his death 11ea1 file&nbsp;<br>
dV V1 of the Ka'ba and upon Islam on his death near the Black stone, I would prefer to die upon Islam,&nbsp;<br>
as I do not know what will be the state of my mind between the door of the Ka'ba and the Black stone.&nbsp;<br>
The saint Abu Darda'a said : By God, the faith of one who remains sure that his faith will not be&nbsp;<br>
snatched at the time of his death will surely be snatched away. The sage Sakil said : The fear of&nbsp;<br>
ultimate end of the truthful occurs at every step and every condition. When Sufiyan was about to die,&nbsp;<br>
he began to weep and tremble. He was asked : 0 Abu Abdullah, you should have hope as God's forgiveness&nbsp;<br>
is greater than your sins. He said : Do I weep for my sins ? If I had known that I would die upon&nbsp;<br>
Tauhid, I would not have cared to meet my Lord with mountainful of sins. The Prophet said : 0 my&nbsp;<br>
disciples, you fear for your sins and we Prophets fear infidelity. There is a tradition that a certain&nbsp;<br>
prophet was complaining to God for several years of hunger, lices and want of cloth. God sent to him&nbsp;<br>
revelation : 0 My servant, are you not satisfied that I have saved you from infidelity ? Even you would&nbsp;<br>
have prayed then for wordly comforts. Then he placed earth on his head and said : 0 Lord, I am&nbsp;<br>
satisfied. Save me from infidelity.<br>
CAUSES OF EVIL END<br>
There are several causes of evil end at death, such as establishment of innovation, hypocrisy, pride&nbsp;<br>
etc. For this reason, the companions feared hypocrisy most. Hazrat Hasan<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	133<br>
Basari said: Had I known that I am free from hypocrisy, it would have been dearer to me than all the&nbsp;<br>
things over which the sun shines. The signs of hypocrisy are nfany. The Prophet said : He Who has got&nbsp;<br>
four things in him is called a hypocrite evern though he prays, fasts and thinks that he is a&nbsp;<br>
Muslim-(1) to speak falsehood when he speaks, (2) to break promise, (3) to break trust when he is&nbsp;<br>
entrusted and (4) to do wrong at the time of dispute (or to break trust after contract). The companions&nbsp;<br>
and their followers gave such an interpretation of hypocrisy that nobody is safe from it. The saint&nbsp;<br>
Hasan Basri said : The meaning of hypocrisy is to make difference between open and secret matters, that&nbsp;<br>
the tongue and heart are not the same and' the inner and outer things are not the same. The companions&nbsp;<br>
of the Prophet used to say : You commit such sins which are more insignificant to you than a hair, but&nbsp;<br>
we considered them as great sins at the time of the Prophet. A certain companion said : The signs of&nbsp;<br>
hypocrisy are to bate which a man does and which he does, to love one who does an oppresive act and to&nbsp;<br>
get dissatisfied with truth. Huzaifa once heard a man rebuking the tyrant Hajjaj and said to him : Do&nbsp;<br>
you think that if Hajjaj would have been present here, you could have rebuked him ? He said : I could&nbsp;<br>
not have 'rebuked him. Huzaifa said : We considered it a hypocrisy at the time of the Prophet. Hazaifa&nbsp;<br>
was an expert in the matter of hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
MEANING OF ULTIMATE EVIL END: The are two conditions of ultimate end. One of them is greater then the&nbsp;<br>
other: If the greater thing becomes strong at the time of death, there is danger. The second thing is&nbsp;<br>
below the first. In this condition, love of the world becomes strong and punishment becomes due. If the&nbsp;<br>
hearts of believer is sound and turns away from the attachment of the world, the fire of Hell tells him&nbsp;<br>
: 0 believer, take rewards as your light extinguished my flame. The second cause is weakness of the&nbsp;<br>
original faith and attachment of the world over mind. God says : Say : If your parents, your children,&nbsp;<br>
your brothers, your wives, your relatives, your wealth which you hoard, your merchandise, slothness of&nbsp;<br>
which you fear and your abode which gives pleasure to you are more loved by you than God and His&nbsp;<br>
Messenger and fighting in His way, then wait till God comes with His order-9:24.<br>
Second condition of ultimate end: In this condition, there are two stages one stage is many sins with&nbsp;<br>
strong faith and<br>
134	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
another stage is few sins with weak faith. What man loves comes before his mind at the time of his&nbsp;<br>
death. If his love is strong for divine service, God's obedience will become more dear to him at that&nbsp;<br>
time if his love is strong for sins, those will come to him at that time. He who commits sins off and&nbsp;<br>
on, remains, aloof from this danger. He who does not commit any sin, remains far distant from this&nbsp;<br>
danger. This can be understood from dreams. Man dreams such thing which he is accustomed to do. He who&nbsp;<br>
comes of age will not see in dream the actual act of coition if he did not do that previously. This is&nbsp;<br>
contrary in the case of one who did the act of coition. Death is like sleep. Everything becomes vivid&nbsp;<br>
at the time of death. The dreams of virtuous men are opposite to those of the sinners as things which&nbsp;<br>
are uppermost in the minds of the former are contrary in the minds of the latter. If one does good&nbsp;<br>
works continually and keeps his mind for long from evil thoughts, they become of his habits and they&nbsp;<br>
become principal things at the time of his death. He courts death upon a thing which he used to do and&nbsp;<br>
he will be resurrected upon that condition.<br>
<br>
A curry seller was taught to recite at the time of his death the Kalema.Shahadat but he was saying&nbsp;<br>
five, six. Thus he was engaged in counting before his death. A certain A'ref said : Arsh is a valuable&nbsp;<br>
jewel. Its light sparkles. The condition in which a man remains is reflected in Arsh. When the swoon of&nbsp;<br>
death comes that reflection is disclosed to him. Similarly his picture will come out on the&nbsp;<br>
Resurrection Day. A sleeping man can know what will happen in future from the Guarded Tablet (Lauhe&nbsp;<br>
Mahfuz). This is reflected in true dreams. So fear of ultimate end is great. The saint Sahal Tastari&nbsp;<br>
said : I saw in dream that I entered Paradise. I saw there about 300 Prophets and asked them : What was&nbsp;<br>
the most fearful of all the fearful things which you saw in the earth ? They said : Evil end. Sudden&nbsp;<br>
death is not good. There is such a condition in sudden death when evil becomes strong and rules over&nbsp;<br>
the heart. About martyrdom, it has been said that at that time soul comes out in such a condition that&nbsp;<br>
the heart does not contain except love. Such a man stands in the row of fight after giving up all&nbsp;<br>
connections in the world. He then purchases the next world in exchange of the world as God said : God&nbsp;<br>
purchased from believers their lives and properties in exchange of Paradise for them-9 : 111. If he&nbsp;<br>
entertains any thought about victory, booty, heroism or power, he does not gain that state of&nbsp;<br>
martyrdom.<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	135<br>
Now it is clear to you about the evil end and its causes. So be prepared for good state at the time of&nbsp;<br>
your death, engage yourself in the divine service of Lord, remove your attachment for the world save&nbsp;<br>
your limbs from sins and save your mind from evil thoughts. Try for these things, so that your mind may&nbsp;<br>
be pure. The present breath may be your last breath. So don't put off anything when you sleep. Sleep in&nbsp;<br>
pure state and remember God. What is uppermost in your mind at the time of sleep remains uppermost at&nbsp;<br>
the time of getting up from bed. Death and resurrection are like going to sleep and getting up from&nbsp;<br>
bed. Similarly the state of mind in which you go to sleep will remain when you get up. Believe it as&nbsp;<br>
sure. If you have not attained the fortune of seeing it with your deep inner sight, you will remain in&nbsp;<br>
great anxiety. Men are in loss except the learned. The learned also are in loss except those who are&nbsp;<br>
engaged in good works. They are also in loss except those who work sincerely and they shall be also in&nbsp;<br>
difficulty except those who remain satisfied in the world with only what is necessary for them.<br>
<br>
What is necessary for you in the world is food, cloth and abode. Everything else is unnecessary. Food&nbsp;<br>
is necessary in such quantity as can keep your backbone erect and save your life. So you should take&nbsp;<br>
such quantity of food. You should not desire food more than what you wish to give out as urine and&nbsp;<br>
stool, as there is no difference in taking food in and letting it out. Both are necessary. Your Taqwa&nbsp;<br>
or God fear is expressed in three things, time, quantity and kinds of food. Regarding time of food it&nbsp;<br>
is sufficient to take food once in 24 hours and its quantity shall not be more than one third of your&nbsp;<br>
stomach. Don't search for tasteful and rich dishes. If you can adopt these three things, you will be&nbsp;<br>
able to give up doubtful foods and you will then get peace by eating lawful foods.<br>
<br>
REGARDING CLOTH AND ABODE. Its object is to save you from heat and cold and to cover private parts. The&nbsp;<br>
cloth which removes heat and cold from your body is sufficient for you and the other clothes are&nbsp;<br>
additional. If you attain the object of cloth, there is no further necessity of cloth. If you do beyond&nbsp;<br>
this you will be like that person who fills up his belly with earth. Similarly. If you get an abode&nbsp;<br>
with roof like sky and bed like earth, it is sufficient for you. If you build special abode for living,&nbsp;<br>
it will be difficult for you and spending your valuable time. If you exceed your limit of necessity and&nbsp;<br>
roam in the valley of hope,<br>
<br>
'il<br>
<br>
I<br>
136	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
<br>
your thoughts will be diverse and God will not care in which valley you will perish. If you cannot do&nbsp;<br>
these things, you can soften your mind by hearing the stories of God fearing men regarding these&nbsp;<br>
things. The wisdom of the Prophets and their companions and the saints and pious men was not less than&nbsp;<br>
that of yours. Think then why they took such rigours of life, why they wept for fear of God, why they&nbsp;<br>
sacrificed their lives in the way of God. They were not hypocrites or cheats. If that does not make&nbsp;<br>
your heart soft, then know that the hearts of the heedless are hard like stone and harder still, as&nbsp;<br>
sometimes stones also gush forth torrents of waters.<br>
STORIES OF FEAR OF ANGELS AND PROPHETS<br>
(1) Hazrat Ayesha reported that whenever there was vehement blowing of winds and storms, the face of&nbsp;<br>
the Prophet became changed. He then walked to and for within the room being fearful of the punishment&nbsp;<br>
of God. Once while reciting the chapter Waqeah he fell into swoon.<br>
(2) Once the Prophet saw the real figure of Gabriel and fell down senseless.<br>
(3) It has been reported that when the Prophet stood in prayer, sound of his breast was heard like the&nbsp;<br>
sound of the boiling waters in a cauldron.<br>
(4) The Prophet said: Whenever Gabriel came to me he used to instill fear of God in me. He was asked:&nbsp;<br>
Why has the condition of the devil become worse? Then Gabriel and Mechael began to weep. God then&nbsp;<br>
revealed to them: Why do you weep? They said: 0 Lord, we are not secure from your plan. God said: So&nbsp;<br>
don't be secure from My plan.<br>
(5) Muhammad-b-Munkader reported: When Hell was created, the hearts of the angels flew away from their&nbsp;<br>
proper places. When the children of Adam were created, those hearts came back. Once the Prophet asked&nbsp;<br>
Gabriel: Why do I not see Michael laugh? Gabriel said: It is said that since the creation of Hell, the&nbsp;<br>
angels did not laugh being fearful of God's punishment.<br>
(6) It has been reported from Ibn-Omar: I came out once with the Prophet. He entered the garden of an&nbsp;<br>
Ansar took some dates and began to eat them. He said: 0 lbn-Omar why don't you eat dates? I said: 0&nbsp;<br>
Prophet of God, I have got no relish. He said: I<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	137<br>
have got relish. Ihave not eaten anything for the last four days having had nothing to eat. If I had&nbsp;<br>
prayed to my Lord. He would have certainly given me the kingdoms of Persia and Byzantium. 0 Ibn Omar,&nbsp;<br>
what will be your condition when you will live among such people who will hoard up their annual food&nbsp;<br>
and whose faith will be weak? He said: By God, soon this verse was revealed: How many an animal there&nbsp;<br>
are who do not bear their provisions. God gives them provision and He is Hearing, Wise-29:60. The&nbsp;<br>
Prophet then said: God has not ordered you to hoard up wealth and to enjoy therewith the comforts of&nbsp;<br>
this transient life, as life is in the hand of God. Beware, I shall not hoard up dirhams and dinars and&nbsp;<br>
shall not hoard up food for tomorrow.<br>
(7) Abu Darda reported: Whenever the Prophet Abraham stood in prayer, the sound of his breast out of&nbsp;<br>
fear of God was heard from a distance of one mile.<br>
(8) Mojahed reported that the Prophet David once wept in prostration for 40 days. He did not raise up&nbsp;<br>
his head till grass grew out of his tears and covered his head. Then proclamation came: 0 David are you&nbsp;<br>
hungry that I would give you food? Are you thirsty that I would give you drink? Are you without cloth&nbsp;<br>
that I would give you cloth? Then he gave out such a long and hot breath that a dry wood caught fire&nbsp;<br>
from it. Then God accepted his repentance and forgave him. Prophet David said: 0 Lord, imprint my sin&nbsp;<br>
on my hands. Thereupon his sins were imprinted on his hands. From that time he began to weep at the&nbsp;<br>
time of taking food, drink and other works. He wept so much that if a cup was placed below his eyes, it&nbsp;<br>
would have been filled up with tears. It is reported that he did not raise up his head towards the sky&nbsp;<br>
till he gave up his life owing to shame of sins.<br>
(9) Prophet David used to say in his Monazat: 0 God, when I remember sins the world becomes narrow for&nbsp;<br>
me inspite of its vastness. When I remember Thy mercy, my life comes within me. I went to one who is a&nbsp;<br>
physician among Thy servants. I informed him of my sins. He told me to return to Thee. Woe to one who&nbsp;<br>
is despaired of Thy mercy. Hazrat Fazil reported that once when Prophet David repented for his sins, he&nbsp;<br>
placed his hand over his head and gave such a loud shriek that its echo came back from the mountains.&nbsp;<br>
The beasts then gathered round him and he said: Return, I have got nothing to say to you. I want that&nbsp;<br>
everybody<br>
i<br>
138	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
should weep for his sins. Don't come to me without weeping. When he was rebuked for excessive weeping,&nbsp;<br>
he said: let me weep before going out for the day of weeping, before my limbs are crushed into dust and&nbsp;<br>
before the angels are ordered to take harsh and stringent measures against me. They don't disobey what&nbsp;<br>
they are ordered with.<br>
<br>
It has been reported that when the weeping of David continued for long and it produced no benefit, his&nbsp;<br>
hands became lean and thin, his thought were heavy and he said: 0 God, don't you feel mercy on me&nbsp;<br>
seeing my condition? God then sent revelation to him: 0 David, forget your sin and I am now remembering&nbsp;<br>
your weeping. He said: 0 Lord, how can I forget my sins? Before I committed sin, the current of&nbsp;<br>
torrents stopped when I recited the Zabur, the blowing of wind stopped, the birds in flocks spread&nbsp;<br>
shades over my head and surrounded me. 0 Lord, that was between You and me. Now there is nothing of it.&nbsp;<br>
God then revealed to him: 0 David, you were in that condition before for extensive love for divine&nbsp;<br>
service and strong attachment. Now there is this condition owing to sin. 0 David, I created Adam up to&nbsp;<br>
My image, I created him with My own hand. I instilled life into him from My Spirit, I made My angels&nbsp;<br>
prostrate before him. I adorned him with My dress of honour. I put upon his head the crown of My&nbsp;<br>
honour. I created for him his mate seeing him alone. I put him in My paradise. But when he disobeyed My&nbsp;<br>
word, I drove him out dishonored and clothless. 0 David, listen to Me. I am telling the truth. You have&nbsp;<br>
obeyed My word for which I accepted your prayer. But when you disobeyed My word, I rejected you. I will&nbsp;<br>
accept you if you return to Me inspite of what has happened to you.<br>
<br>
(10) The sage Ibn Qasir reported: I heard that whenever David wished to repent, he used not to eat and&nbsp;<br>
drink before it and to cohabit with his wife for seven days. When only one day remained, his pulpit was&nbsp;<br>
once taken out He ordered his son Solaiman to call all to hear his bewailings. Then the beasts and&nbsp;<br>
birds came out and men and women assembled in thee field. Then David ascended on the pulpit and all sat&nbsp;<br>
around him including Solaiman. Then Prophet David after reciting praise of God wept and shrieked and&nbsp;<br>
began his song of repentance. It was so forceful and impressive that a party of men and beasts and&nbsp;<br>
birds expired. When Solaiman saw this, he said, 0 father, the<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	139<br>
audience have become exasperated and many men, birds and beasts expired'. At this, he fell into swoon.&nbsp;<br>
Solaiman then carried him on a palanquin. When he recovered he entered his praying place and after&nbsp;<br>
closing its doors said: 0 Lord, are you dissatisfied with David? Solaiman sought permission to enter&nbsp;<br>
the room with a dish of food and said: 0 father, eat the food and gather strength.<br>
(11) The sage Rakkashi reported: One day Prophet David came out to admonish the people the number of&nbsp;<br>
whom was forty thousands. After learning his sermon, thirty thousand persons breathed their last. Only&nbsp;<br>
ten thousands could return home. When his body was about to fall out of fear of God, his men made him&nbsp;<br>
stand on his feet.<br>
(12) Hazrat Ibn Omar reporte: Hazrat Ihya, son of Prophet Zakaria, once entered Baitual Moqaddas when&nbsp;<br>
he was 8 years old and saw that the worshippers wore dress of wool and some of them leaned themselves&nbsp;<br>
against the pillars of the mosque; At this, he went to his parents out of fear. Some of the boys of the&nbsp;<br>
street called him to play and he said to them: I have not been created to play. Then he asked his&nbsp;<br>
parents to dress him with dress of wool. When this was done, he went to the mosque. During day time, he&nbsp;<br>
used to serve the mosque and at night time he used to do divine service therein. When he was 15 years&nbsp;<br>
old, he came out of the mosque and took refuge to a cave of a mountain. His parents searched for him&nbsp;<br>
and found him near a fountain in the condition that he put his feet in water although he was about to&nbsp;<br>
die parched with thirst and saying: By Thy honour and glory, I will not drink this cold water till I&nbsp;<br>
know my condition His parents requested him to eat and drink with them to which he responded and paid&nbsp;<br>
expiation of his oath. His parents took him to the sacred mosque. When he wept in prayer, the trees and&nbsp;<br>
plants used to weep with him. His father also used to weep so much at seeing his son's weeping that he&nbsp;<br>
sometimes fell in swoon. He wept so much that the flesh of his cheeks melted and his teeth were visible&nbsp;<br>
and assumed an ugly look. His mother once said to him: 0 my dear son, if you give me permission, I may&nbsp;<br>
cover your face. When he gave her permission, his mother covered his face with an old skin. When he&nbsp;<br>
prayed, he wept and the skin became wet with his tears and his mother squeezed the skin.<br>
(13) One day the prophet Zakaria said to him: 0 my dear son, I prayed to God to console my eyes through&nbsp;<br>
you. Prophet<br>
140	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
Ihya said: 0 father, Gabriel gave me the news that there is a vast field between Hell and Paradise.&nbsp;<br>
Nobody will be able to cross it except one who weeps for fear of God. Zakaria said, 0 darling, then&nbsp;<br>
keep on weeping.<br>
(14) Jesus Christ said: 0 my disciples, patience arises out of sorrows and difficulties out of God-fear&nbsp;<br>
and love of Ferdous and keeps one away from the world. I tell you with truth that it is a common word&nbsp;<br>
to search for Ferdous by eating barley and lying in the foul places with dogs.<br>
(15) It has been reported that when Abraham remembered his sins, he fell into swoon and the sound of&nbsp;<br>
his breast was heard from a distance of one mile. Gabriel then came to him and said: Your Lord tenders&nbsp;<br>
you salam and says: Have you seen a friend fearing his friend? He then said: 0 Gabriel when I remember&nbsp;<br>
my sins, I forget friendship. So there are innumerable sayings about the fear of the Prophets.<br>
FEAR OF COMPANIONS AND OTHER SAGES<br>
(1) Once Hazrat Abu Bakr said to. a bird: 0 bird, how good it would have been if I would been a bird&nbsp;<br>
like you and not a man! (2) Abu Zarr said: Would that I would have been a tree fit to be cut. (3)&nbsp;<br>
Hazrat Osman said: Would that after my death, I would not have been resurrected. (4) Hazrat Ayesha&nbsp;<br>
said: Had I been a thing to be forgotten. (5) It has been reported that when the Prophet once read the&nbsp;<br>
Quran, he fell in swoon out of fear and for several days he did not recover. One day he took a handful&nbsp;<br>
of dirt and said: Alas! Would that I would have been earth. Would that I would have been a thing not td&nbsp;<br>
be mentioned. Would that my mother would not have given birth to me. (6) Two black spots fell in the&nbsp;<br>
face of Hazrat Omar as a result of his shedding tears. He said: The anger of one who fears God is not&nbsp;<br>
expressed. He who fear God does not do what he likes. One day he recited: When the sun would be lifted,&nbsp;<br>
when the books of deeds would be spread&quot;. When he reached upto this verse, he fell into swoon. One day&nbsp;<br>
Hazrat Omar was passing by a house in which the owner was reciting the chapter Tur (52). He was over&nbsp;<br>
hearing it. When he reached this verse: Surely the punishment of your Lord must come to pass and there&nbsp;<br>
is nobody to prevent it-(52):8Q). he alighted from his ass and stayed for long after leaning against a&nbsp;<br>
wall. When he returned home, he suffered from illness for a month.<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	141<br>
Hazrat Ali said: I saw the companions of the Prophet but I did not see them before in the condition in&nbsp;<br>
which I see them today. Their hairs are dishevelled, their dress mixed with dust. They spend the whole&nbsp;<br>
night in prayer and recite the verses of God. They stay on their foreheads and feet in divine service.&nbsp;<br>
When the day dawns, they are engaged in Zikr in such a manner as the trees are moved by storm. Their&nbsp;<br>
eyes shed tears, so much so that they wet their clothes. Thereafter he did not laugh till he was struck&nbsp;<br>
with dagger.<br>
<br>
Hazrat Ihya used to weep much. One day a man recited the following verse: When they will wait before&nbsp;<br>
their Lord-have you considered it? At that time he gave such a loud shriek that he fell ill and&nbsp;<br>
suffered for four months. The people from the town of Basra used to come to see him.<br>
<br>
Hazrat Ibn Abbas was asked about two God fearing men and he said: Their hearts are stricken with fear&nbsp;<br>
of God and their eyes shed tears. They say: When death is behind our back how can we make enjoyments?&nbsp;<br>
When graves are in our front when the Hour has been promised near when our path is over Hell and when&nbsp;<br>
we stand facing God, how can we engage ourselves in enjoyments? The saint Hatem Asem said: Don't be&nbsp;<br>
deceived by your good abode as there is no better place than Paradise. Hazrat Adam got therein his&nbsp;<br>
enjoyments. Don't be deceived that you have done a good deal of divine service, as you know the&nbsp;<br>
condition of the devil although he did divine service for long. Don't take pride for your learning as&nbsp;<br>
you should look to the condition of Balaram even though he knew the greatest name of God Don't be&nbsp;<br>
overjoyed' because of the companionship of pious men, as nobody got such a fortune as the Prophet but&nbsp;<br>
his relatives got no benefit though they lived with him.<br>
<br>
It has been reported that an Ansar youth used to weep for fear of Hell and stayed at home. The Prophet&nbsp;<br>
came to him and as soon as he embraced him, he fell down dead. The Prophet said: Bury your companion as&nbsp;<br>
his liver has melted owing to fear of Hell. A man asked the saint Forqad: Inform us of any wonderful&nbsp;<br>
news of Banu Israil. He said: I heard that 500 unmarried girls once entered the sacred mosque at&nbsp;<br>
Jerusalem. They wore coarse cloths and blankets. When they were reminded of God's punishment, they all&nbsp;<br>
breathed their last in the same day.<br>
142	FEAR AND HOPE	Vol-IV<br>
The saint Ali Salami was a God-fearing man. He did never pray for paradise and only prayed for&nbsp;<br>
forgiveness. When he was asked during his illness whether he had any desire, he said: Fear of Hell did&nbsp;<br>
not leave any place in my mind for any desire. It has been said of him that he used not to raise his&nbsp;<br>
head towards the sky out of fear and did not laugh for forty years. One day he raised up his head&nbsp;<br>
towards the sky and at once he fell down senseless out of fear and his intestines were cut.<br>
Hazrat Ata said: One day we came out with Otbatul Golam. There were old and young men with us. They&nbsp;<br>
used to pray Fajr prayer with the ablution of Isha prayers. Their feet got swollen owing to long&nbsp;<br>
standing in prayers. Their eyes went into sockets and their flesh was mixed with their bones and their&nbsp;<br>
glands remained like wood. When they got up at dawn, it was seen that their skins became like outer&nbsp;<br>
covers of water-melon as if they came out of their graves. They gave information how God honoured the&nbsp;<br>
pious and destroyed the sinners. When they travelled they used to fall in swoon whenever they heard the&nbsp;<br>
recitation of any verse. The companions of Otbah were weeping sitting round him in an intensely cold&nbsp;<br>
day. His perspiration began to come out in the state of swoon. They brought water and washed his face&nbsp;<br>
and he regained consciousness. When they asked him about his state, he said: I remembered that I&nbsp;<br>
committed a sin here.<br>
Saleh Mari said: One day I read out this verse of the Quran to a pious man: 'The day in which their&nbsp;<br>
faces will be turned up side down in Hell. He said: Alas for us, we obeyed God and His Prophet. Then he&nbsp;<br>
fell into swoon. When he recovered he said: 0 Saleh, recite more verses as I am overtaken by fear. Then&nbsp;<br>
he recited this verse: Whenever they will wish to come out of Hell, they will be taken back therein'.&nbsp;<br>
After hearing this verse, he breathed his last.<br>
It has been narrated that Hazrat Jarrah-b-Abi Aufa was leading the Fajr prayer as Imam. When he recited&nbsp;<br>
this verse. When the Trumpet will be blown, he at once fell down senseless and expired. The saint Yezid&nbsp;<br>
Raqqashi once went to Caliph Omar-b- Abdul Aziz who said: 0 Yezid, give me advice. He said: 0 Commander&nbsp;<br>
of the Faithful, know that you are not the first Caliph to die. At this he began to weep and said: Give&nbsp;<br>
me more advice. He said: 0 Commander of the Faithful, there was no such<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	143<br>
father between Adam and you who did not die. At this he began to weep. He said: 0 Yezid give me more&nbsp;<br>
advice. He said: 0 Commandeer of the Faithful there is no good abode of yours except Hell and Paradise.&nbsp;<br>
At this, he fell down senseless. Maimun-b-Mehran said: When this verse was revealed: Surely Hell was&nbsp;<br>
promised for them all, Salman Faresi raised a loud shriek, placed his hands on his head and began to&nbsp;<br>
run outside for three days. Nobody could catch him.<br>
<br>
One day, the said Daud Tai saw a woman near the grave of her son weeping and saying: 0 darling, I don't&nbsp;<br>
know which cheek of yours has been eaten by worms. At this Daud Tai fell down.' senseless. When Sufyan&nbsp;<br>
Saori fell ill the details of his illness were presented to a non-believer physician who said: Fear has&nbsp;<br>
severed the liver of the man. Then he touched his veins and said: I don't know that there is a man like&nbsp;<br>
him in Hanifi religion. The saint Abdullah-b-A's said: Weep. If you cannot weep, do like that. By One&nbsp;<br>
in whose hand there is my life, had you had knowledge, you would have raised such a loud shriek that&nbsp;<br>
would have choked your voice. You would have prayed such a prayer that would have broken your back. The&nbsp;<br>
saint Saleh Mari said: Ibn Samak once came to me and said: Show me some wonderful acts of your men. I&nbsp;<br>
took him to a man who lived in a cottage. We sought permission. to go to him and saw him making a mat.&nbsp;<br>
I recited to him this verse: When chains would fall on their neck they will swim in hot water and they&nbsp;<br>
will be burnt in Hell fire. The man raised such a loud shriek that he fell down senseless. We came out&nbsp;<br>
leaving him in that condition and came to another man to whom we recited the above verse. As a result,&nbsp;<br>
he also fell down senseless., We along with our spiritual guide went to a third person. He said: If you&nbsp;<br>
desire to make me unmindful of our Lord, then come. Then I read: This is for one who fears My glory and&nbsp;<br>
fears My warning. Then he raised such a loud shriek that blood was oozing out from his nose and that&nbsp;<br>
wetted his clothes and it became dried up. We came out leaving him in that condition. Then we went to&nbsp;<br>
six saints and we recited verses and they also fell into swoon. Then we went to the seventh saint and&nbsp;<br>
sought permission to see him. It was given and we entered and saw an old man sitting in praying cloth.&nbsp;<br>
We saluted him, but he could not understand it. I said loudly: Beware, tomorrow the people will keep&nbsp;<br>
standing. The old man said: Alas for you. Then he was bewildered and his mouth remained open His eyes&nbsp;<br>
went upward<br>
144	. FEAR AND HOPE .	Vol-IV<br>
and he said in a low voice: Alas.'Then That voice also stopped. His wife said: Go out as you cannot get&nbsp;<br>
any benefit from him. Some days after this, I enquired from the people and came to know that three of&nbsp;<br>
them recovered their senses and three reached God. The old man was in that condition for three days and&nbsp;<br>
could not do his compulsory duties. After three days, he regained his sense.<br>
<br>
People considered the saint Ezid-b-Aswad as one of Abbals. He promised that he would never laugh never&nbsp;<br>
sleep on bed and never eat food having fat up to his death. He was not seen to laugh,or lie on bed and&nbsp;<br>
eat food having fat. The governor Hajjaj once asked Sayeed-b-Zubair: I heard that you do not laugh. He&nbsp;<br>
said: How can I laugh when the fire of Hell is burning and the chains are ready?<br>
A man asked Hazrat Hasan Basri: 0 Abu Syeed,, how have you got up from bed at dawn? He said: In good&nbsp;<br>
condition. He again asked: How are you? Hasan Basri smiled and said: Are you asking me about my&nbsp;<br>
condition? What do you think about the man who got on board a boat. When it reached the middle of the&nbsp;<br>
sea, it was broken and every passenger floated on a plank. What is their condition? One man said:&nbsp;<br>
Grievous moment Hazrat Hasan said: My condition is more precarious than their condition.<br>
One female slave went to Caliph Omar-b-Abdul Aziz and prayed two rakats in his house. Then she went to&nbsp;<br>
sleep and dreamt. She got up from sleep and said: 0 Commander of the Faithful, I have seen a wonderful&nbsp;<br>
dream. He said: What is that? She said: I saw Hell burning and the Bridge was placed on it. Then Caliph&nbsp;<br>
Solaiman- b-Abdul Malek was bought there and placed on that bridge. When he proceeded some steps, the&nbsp;<br>
bridge turned down and he fell into fire. Caliph Omar then asked her: What happened next? She said:&nbsp;<br>
Then you have been brought there. The Caliph raised such a loud shriek that he fell down senseless. The&nbsp;<br>
female slave said in his ears loudly: 0 Commander of the Faithful, by God, I saw you safe and secure.&nbsp;<br>
Then the Caliph moved his feet.<br>
It has been narrated that the saint Hasan Basri did not laugh for 40 years. The narrator said: Whenever&nbsp;<br>
I saw him sitting it seemed that he was a prisoner condemned to death. When he made sermon, it seemed&nbsp;<br>
that he was seeing as it were the next<br>
Vol-IV THE BOOK OF CONSTRUCTIVE VIRTUES	145<br>
world and giving information after he has seen it. When he remained silent it seemed the the fire of&nbsp;<br>
Hell was burning before his eyes. When he was rebuked once for his excessive fear, he said: Who will&nbsp;<br>
give me surety that God will not rebuke me for my faults and say: Go, I have forgiven you. Then I will&nbsp;<br>
require no divine service.<br>
These are the stories of the Prophets saints and religious men about God-fear. We should fear more as&nbsp;<br>
we are engrossed in numerable sins. Passions are strong in us, misfortune is prevailing over us and we&nbsp;<br>
do not see our condition owing to our negligence and hardness of heart. Even we do not wake up at the&nbsp;<br>
advent of death. Our minds do not become soft by the thoughts of the ultimate end. We pray to God that&nbsp;<br>
He may do us good out of His infinite mercy.<br>
It is wonderful that when we wise to get wealth of the world, we gather instruments of acquiring it,&nbsp;<br>
sow crops, plant trees, do business, embark on seas and oceans and face insurmountable dangers and&nbsp;<br>
difficulties. When we wish to acquire learning, we take endless troubles. When God gave us assurance of&nbsp;<br>
our provision we do not sit idle on that assurance but say: 0 God, give us provision. But when we look&nbsp;<br>
to the everlasting abode of the next world, we remain satisfied by saying with our tongue: 0 God,&nbsp;<br>
forgive us. We invoke Him on whom we cherish hope but He says: There is nothing for men but what he&nbsp;<br>
strives for&quot;. &quot;Let them not be deceived by false hope. 0 man, what has deceived you with regard to your&nbsp;<br>
gracious Lord?&quot; These verses even do not awakens and do not take us from the hell of deception. Let us&nbsp;<br>
take caution from the above stories and examples and follow the religious paths in the transient world.<br>

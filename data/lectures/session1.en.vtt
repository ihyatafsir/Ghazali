00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.000
We begin today with the Book of Knowledge, Kitab al-'Ilm.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Imam al-Ghazali, rahimahullah, places this as the foundation of his revival.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
He says that knowledge is the starting point of worship.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:28.000
And he cites the verse: "Allah witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and the angels and those of knowledge."

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Notice the order here: Allah first, then the angels, then the scholars.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.000
This aligns with the hadith: "Scholars are the heirs of the Prophets."

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.000
So when we translate "Kitab al-'Ilm", we must understand it's not just information, but transformative knowledge.
